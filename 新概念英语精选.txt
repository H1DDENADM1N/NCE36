    <p class="title">Lesson 14 Anoble gangster 贵族歹徒</p>
    <p class="en">There was a time when the owners of shops and businesses in Chicago had to pay large sums of money
        to
        gangsters in return for 'protection.' If the money was not paid promptly, the gangsters would quickly put a man
        out
        of business by destroying his shop. Obtaining 'protection money' is not a modern crime. As long ago as the
        fourteenth century, an Englishman, Sir John Hawkwood, made the remarkable discovery that people would rather pay
        large sums of money than have their life work destroyed by gangsters.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        曾经有一个时期,芝加哥的店主和商行的老板们不得不拿出大笔的钱给歹徒以换取&quot;保护&quot;。如果交款不及时,歹徒们就会很快捣毁他的商店,让他破产.榨取&quot;保护金&quot;并不是一种现代的罪恶行径.早在14世纪,英国人约翰.霍克伍德就有过非凡的发现:&quot;人们情愿拿出大笔的钱,也不愿毕生的心血毁于歹徒之手.
    </p>
    <p class="en">Six hundred years ago, Sir Johan Hawkwood arrived in Italy with a band of soldiers and settled near
        Florence. He soon made a name for himself and came to be known to the Italians as Giovanni Acuto. Whenever the
        Italian city-states were at war with each other, Hawkwood used to hire his soldiers to princes who were willing
        to
        pay the high price he demanded. In times of peace, when business was bad, Hawkwood and his men would march into
        a
        city-state and, after burning down a few farms, would offer to go away if protection money was paid to them.
        Hawkwood made large sums of money in this way. In spite of this, the Italians regarded him as a sort of hero.
        When
        he died at the age of eighty, the Florentines gave him a state funeral and had a pictured painted which was
        dedicated to the memory of 'the most valiant soldier and most notable leader, Signor Giovanni Haukodue.'</p>
    <p class="cn">
        600年前,约翰.霍克伍德爵士带着一队士兵来到意大利,在佛罗伦萨附近驻扎下来,很快就出了名.意大利人叫他乔凡尼.阿库托.每次意大利各城邦之间发生战争,霍克伍德把他的士兵雇佣给愿给他出高价的君主。和平时期,当生意萧条时,霍克伍德便带领士兵进入某个城邦,纵火烧毁一两个农场,然后提出,如向他们缴纳保护金,他们便主动撤离。霍克伍德用这种方法挣了大笔钱.尽管如此,意大利人还是把他视作某种英雄。他80岁那年死去时,佛罗伦萨人为他举行了国葬,并为他画像以纪念这位&quot;骁勇无比的战士、杰出的领袖乔凡尼.阿库托先生.&quot;

    <p class="title">Lesson 17 The longest suspension bridge in the world 世界上最长的吊桥</p>
    <p class="en">Verrazano, an Italian about whom little is known, sailed into New York Harbour in 1524 and named it
        Angouleme. He described it as 'a very agreeable situation located within two small hills in the midst of which
        flowed a great river.' Though Verrazano is by no means considered to be a great explorer, his name will probably
        remain immortal, for on November 21st, 1964, the longest suspension bridge in the world was named after him.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        1524年，一位鲜为人知的意大利人维拉萨诺驾船驶进纽约港，并将该港名为安古拉姆。他对该港作了这样的描述：“地理位置十分适宜，位于两座小山的中间，一条大河从中间流过”。虽然维拉萨诺绝对算不上一个伟大的探险家，但他的名字将流芳百世，因为1964年11月21日建成的一座世界上最长的吊桥是以他的名字命名。
    </p>
    <p class="en">The Verrazano Bridge, which was designed by Othmar Ammann, joins Brooklyn to Staten Island. It has a
        span
        of 4,260 feet. The bridge is so long that the shape of the earth had to be taken into account by its designer.
        Two
        great towers support four huge cables. The towers are built on immense underwater platforms made of steel and
        concrete. The platforms extend to a depth of over 100 feet under the sea. These alone took sixteen months to
        build.
        Above the surface of the water, the towers rise to a height of nearly 700 feet. They support the cables from
        which
        the bridge has been suspended. Each of the four cables contains 26,108 lengths of wire. It has been estimated
        that
        if the bridge were packed with cars, it would still only be carrying a third of its total capacity. However,
        size
        and strength are not the only important things about this bridge. Despite its immensity, it is both simple and
        elegant, fulfilling its designer's dream to create 'an enormous object drawn as faintly as possible'.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        维拉萨诺大桥由奥斯马.阿曼设计，连结着布鲁克林与斯塔顿岛，桥长4,260英尺。由于桥身太长，设计者不得不考虑了地表的形状。两座巨塔支撑着4根粗大的钢缆。塔身建在巨大的水下钢盘混凝土平台上。平台深入海底100英尺。仅这两座塔就花了16个月才建成。塔身高出水面将近700英尺。高塔支撑着钢缆，而钢缆又悬吊着大桥，4根钢缆中的每根由26，108股钢绳组成。据估计，若桥上摆满了汽车，也只不过是桥的总承载力的1/3。然而，这座桥重要特点不仅是它的规模与强度。尽管此桥很大，但它的结构简单，造型优美，实现了设计者企图创造一个“尽量用细线条勾画出一个庞然大物”的梦想。

    <p class="title">Lesson 21 Daniel Mendoza 丹尼尔.门多萨</p>
    <p class="en">Boxing matches were very popular in England two hundred years ago. In those days, boxers fought with
        bare
        fists for prize money. Because of this, they were known as 'prize-fighters'. However, boxing was very crude, for
        there were no rules and a prize-fighter could be seriously injured or even killed during a match.</p>
    <p class="cn">两百年前，拳击比赛在英国非常盛行。当时，拳击手们不戴手套，为争夺奖金而搏斗。因此，他们被称作“职业拳击手”。不过，拳击是十分野蛮的，因为当时没有任何比赛规则，职业拳击手有可能在比赛中受重伤，甚至丧命。
    </p>
    <p class="en">One of the most colourful figures in boxing history was Daniel Mendoza, who was born in 1764. The
        use
        of
        gloves was not introduced until 1860, when the Marquis of Queensberry drew up the first set of rules. Though he
        was
        technically a prize-fighter, Mendoza did much to change crude prize-fighting into a sport, for he brought
        science to
        the game. In his day, Mendoza enjoyed tremendous popularity. He was adored by rich and poor alike.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        拳击史上最引人注目的人物之一是丹尼尔.门多萨，他生于1764年。1860年昆斯伯里侯爵第一次为拳击比赛制定了规则，拳击比赛这才用上了手套。虽然门多萨严格来讲不过是个职业拳击手，但在把这种粗野的拳击变成一种体育运动方面，他做出了重大贡献。是他把科学引进了这项运动。门多萨在他的全盛时期深受大家欢迎，无论是富人还是穷人都对他崇拜备至。
    </p>
    <p class="en">Mendoza rose to fame swiftly after a boxing-match when he was only fourteen years old. This
        attracted
        the
        attention of Richard Humphries who was then the most eminent boxer in England. He offered to train Mendoza and
        his
        young pupil was quick to learn. In fact, Mendoza soon became so successful that Humphries turned against him.
        The
        two men quarrelled bitterly and it was clear that the argument could only be settled by a fight. A match was
        held at
        Stilton, where both men fought for an hour. The public bet a great deal of money on Mendoza, but he was
        defeated.
        Mendoza met Humphries in the ring on a later occasion and he lost for a second time. It was not until his third
        match in 1790 that he finally beat Humphries and became Champion of England. Meanwhile, he founded a highly
        successful Academy and even Lord Byron became one of his pupils. He earned enormous sums of money and was paid
        as
        much as 100 pounds for a single appearance. Despite this, he was so extravagant that he was always in debt.
        After he
        was defeated by a boxer called Gentleman Jackson, he was quickly forgotten. He was sent to prison for failing to
        pay
        his debts and died in poverty in 1836.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        门多萨在14岁时参加一场拳击赛后一举成名。这引起当时英国拳坛名将理查德.汉弗莱斯的注意。他主动提出教授门多萨，而年少的门多萨一学就会。事实上，门多萨不久便名声大振，致使汉弗莱斯与他反目为敌。两个人争吵不休，显而易见，只有较量一番才能解决问题。于是两人在斯蒂尔顿设下赛场，厮打了一个小时。公众把大笔赌注下到了门多萨身上，但他却输了。后来，门多萨与汉弗莱斯再次在拳击场上较量，门多萨又输了一场。直到1790年他们第3次对垒，门多萨才终于击败汉弗莱斯，成了全英拳击冠军。同时，他建立了一所拳击学校，办得很成功，连拜伦勋爵也成了他的学生。门多萨挣来大笔大笔的钱，一次出场费就多可达100英镑。尽管收入不少，但他挥霍无度，经常债台高筑。他被一个叫杰克逊绅士的拳击手击败后很快被遗忘。他因无力还债而被捕入狱，最后于1836年在贫困中死去。

    <p class="title">Lesson 24 A skeleton in the cupboard “家丑”</p>
    <p class="en">We often read in novels how a seemingly respectable person or family has some terrible secret which
        has
        been concealed from strangers for years. The English language possesses a vivid saying to describe this sort of
        situation. The terrible secret is called ‘a skeleton in the cupboard’. At some dramatic moment in the story, the
        terrible secret becomes known and a reputation is ruined. The reader's hair stands on end when he reads in the
        final
        pages of the novel that the heroine, a dear old lady who had always been so kind to everybody, had, in her
        youth,
        poisoned every one of her five husbands.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        在小说中，我们经常读到一个表面上受人尊重的人物或家族，却有着某种多年不为人所知的骇人听闻的秘密。英语中有一个生动的说法来形容这种情况。惊人的秘密被称作“柜中骷髅”。在小说的某个戏剧性时刻，可怕的秘密泄漏出来，接着便是某人的声誉扫地。当读者读到小说最后几页了解到书中女主人公，那位一向待大家很好的可爱的老妇人年轻时一连毒死了她的5个丈夫时，不禁会毛骨悚然。
    </p>
    <p class="en">It is all very well for such things to occur in fiction. To varying degrees, we all have secrets
        which we
        do not want even our closest friends to learn, but few of us have skeletons in the cupboard. The only person I
        know
        who has a skeleton in the cupboard is George Carlton, and he is very proud of the fact. George studied medicine
        in
        his youth. Instead of becoming a doctor, however, he became a successful writer of detective stories. I once
        spent
        an uncomfortable weekend which I shall never forget at his house. George showed me to the guest-room which, he
        said,
        was rarely used. He told me to unpack my things and then come down to dinner. After I had stacked my shirts and
        underclothes in two empty drawers, I decided to hang one of the two suits I had brought with me in the cupboard.
        I
        opened the cupboard door and then stood in front of it petrified. A skeleton was dangling before my eyes. The
        sudden
        movement of the door made it sway slightly and it gave me the impression that it was about to leap out at me.
        Dropping my suit, I dashed downstairs to tell George. This was worse than ‘a terrible secret’; this was a real
        skeleton! But George was unsympathetic. ‘Oh, that,’ he said with a smile as if he were talking about an old
        friend.
        ‘That's Sebastian. You forget that I was a medical student once upon a time. ’</p>
    <p class="cn">
        这种事发生在小说中是无可非议的。尽管我们人人都有各种大小秘密，连最亲密的朋友都不愿让他们知道，但我们当中极少有人有柜中骷髅。我所认识的唯一的在柜中藏骷髅的人便是乔治-卡尔顿，他甚至引以为自豪。乔治年轻时学过医，然而，他后来没当上医生，却成了一位成功的侦探小说作家。有一次，我在他家里度周末，过得很不愉快。这事我永远不会忘记。乔治把我领进客房，说这间房间很少使用。他让我打开行装后下楼吃饭。我将衬衫、内衣放进两个空抽屉里，然后我想把随身带来的两套西服中的一套挂到大衣柜里去。我打开柜门，站在柜门前一下子惊呆了。一具骷髅悬挂在眼前，由于柜门突然打开，它也随之轻微摇晃起来，让我觉得它好像马上要跳出柜门朝我扑过来似的。我扔下西服冲下楼去告诉乔治。这是比“骇人听闻的秘密”更加惊人的东西，这是一具真正的骷髅啊！但乔治却无动于衷。“噢，是它呀！他笑着说道，俨然在谈论一位老朋友。“那是塞巴斯蒂安。你忘了我以前是学医的了。”

    <p class="title">Lesson 27 Nothing to sell and nothing to buy 没有东西可卖也没有东西可买</p>
    <p class="en">It has been said that everyone lives by selling something. In the light of this statement, teachers
        live
        by selling knowledge, philosophers by selling wisdom and priests by selling spiritual comfort. Though it may be
        possible to measure the value of material good in terms of money, it is extremely difficult to estimate the true
        value of the services which people perform for us. There are times when we would willingly give everything we
        possess to save our lives, yet we might grudge paying a surgeon a high fee for offering us precisely this
        service.
        The conditions of society are such that skills have to be paid for in the same way that goods are paid for at a
        shop. Everyone has something to sell.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        据说每个人都靠出售某种东西来维持生活。根据这种说法，教师靠卖知识为生，哲学家靠卖智慧为生，牧师靠卖精神安慰为生。虽然物质产品的价值可以用金钱来衡量，但要估算别人为我们为所提供的服务的价值却是极其困难的。有时，我们为了挽救生命，愿意付出我们所占有的一切。但就在外科大夫给我们提供了这种服务后，我们却可能为所支付的昂贵的费用而抱怨。社会上的情况就是如此，技术是必须付钱去买的，就像在商店里要花钱买商品一样。人人都有东西可以出售。
    </p>
    <p class="en">Tramps seem to be the only exception to this general rule. Beggars almost sell themselves as human
        beings
        to arouse the pity of passers-by. But real tramps are not beggars. They have nothing to sell and require nothing
        from others. In seeking independence, they do not sacrifice their human dignity. A tramp may ask you for money,
        but
        he will never ask you to feel sorry for him. He has deliberately chosen to lead the life he leads and is fully
        aware
        of the consequences. He may never be sure where the next meal is coming from, but he is free from the thousands
        of
        anxieties which afflict other people. His few material possessions make it possible for him to move from place
        to
        place with ease. By having to sleep in the open, he gets far closer to the world of nature than most of us ever
        do.
        He may hunt, beg, or steal occasionally to keep himself alive; he may even, in times of real need, do a little
        work;
        but he will never sacrifice his freedom. We often speak of tramps with contempt and put them in the same class
        as
        beggars, but how many of us can honestly say that we have not felt a little envious of their simple way of life
        and
        their freedom from care?</p>
    <p class="cn">
        在这条普遍的规律前面，好像只有流浪汉是个例外，乞丐出售的几乎是他本人，以引起过路人的怜悯。但真正的流浪并不是乞丐。他们既不出售任何东西，也不需要从别人那儿得到任何东西，在追求独立自由的同时，他们并不牺牲为人的尊严。游浪汉可能会向你讨钱，但他从来不要你可怜他。他是故意在选择过那种生活的，并完全清楚以这种方式生活的后果。他可能从不知道下顿饭有无着落，但他不像有人那样被千万桩愁事所折磨。他几乎没有什么财产，这使他能够轻松自如地在各地奔波。由于被迫在露天睡觉，他比我们中许多人都离大自然近得多。为了生存，他可能会去打猎、乞讨，偶尔偷上一两回；确实需要的时候，他甚至可能干一点儿活，但他决不会牺牲自由。说起流浪汉，我们常常带有轻蔑并把他们与乞丐归为一类。但是，我们中有多少人能够坦率地说我们对流浪汉的简朴生活与无忧无虑的境况不感到有些羡慕呢？

    <p class="title">Lesson 33 A day to remember 难忘的一天</p>
    <p class="en">We have all experienced days when everything goes wrong. A day may begin well enough, but suddenly
        everything seems to get out of control. What invariably happens is that a great number of things choose to go
        wrong
        at precisely the same moment. It is as if a single unimportant event set up a chain of reactions. Let us suppose
        that you are preparing a meal and keeping an eye on the baby at the same time. The telephone rings and this
        marks
        the prelude to an unforeseen series of catastrophes. While you are on the phone, the baby pulls the table-cloth
        off
        the table, smashing half your best crockery and cutting himself in the process. You hang up hurriedly and attend
        to
        baby, crockery, etc. Meanwhile, the meal gets burnt. As if this were not enough to reduce you to tears, your
        husband
        arrives, unexpectedly bringing three guests to dinner.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        我们大家都有过事事不顺心的日子。一天开始时，可能还不错，但突然间似乎一切都失去了控制。情况经常是这样的，许许多多的事情都偏偏赶在同一时刻出问题，好像是一件无关紧要的小事引起了一连串的连锁反应。假设你在做饭，同时又在照看孩子。这时电话铃响了，它预示着一连串意想不到的灾难的来临。就在你接电话时，孩子把桌布从桌子上扯了下来，将家中最好的陶瓷餐具半数摔碎，同时也弄伤了他自己。你急急忙忙挂上电话，赶去照看孩子和餐具。这时，饭又烧糊了。好像这一切还不足以使你急得掉泪，你的丈夫接着回来了，事先没打招呼就带来3个客人吃饭。
    </p>
    <p class="en">Things can go wrong on a big scale, as a number of people recently discovered in Parramatta, a
        suburb
        of
        Sydney. During the rush hour one evening two cars collided and both drivers began to argue. The woman
        immediately
        behind the two cars happened to be a learner. She suddenly got into a panic and stopped her car. This made the
        driver following her brake hard. His wife was sitting beside him holding a large cake. As she was thrown
        forward,
        the cake went right through the windscreen and landed on the road. Seeing a cake flying through the air, a
        lorry–driver who was drawing up alongside the car, pulled up all of a sudden. The lorry was loaded with empty
        beer
        bottles and hundreds of them slid off the back of the vehicle and on to the road. This led to yet another angry
        argument. Meanwhile, the traffic piled up behind. It took the police nearly an hour to get the traffic on the
        move
        again. In the meantime, the lorry driver had to sweep up hundreds of broken bottles. Only two stray dogs
        benefited
        from all this confusion, for they greedily devoured what was left of the cake. It was just one of those days!
    </p>
    <p class="cn">
        就像许多人最近在悉尼郊区帕拉马塔所发现的那样，有时乱子会闹得很大。一天傍晚交通最拥挤时，一辆汽车撞上前面一辆汽车，两个司机争吵起来。紧跟其后的一辆车上的司机碰巧是个初学者，她一惊之下突然把车停了下来。她这一停使得跟在后头的司机也来了个急刹车。司机的妻子正坐在他身边，手里托着块大蛋糕。她往前一冲，蛋糕从挡风玻璃飞了出去掉在马路上。此时，一辆卡车正好从后边开到那辆汽车边上，司机看见一块蛋糕从天而降，紧急刹车。卡车上装着空啤酒瓶，成百只瓶子顺势从卡车后面滑出车外落在马路上。这又引起了一场唇枪舌剑的争吵。与此同时，后面的车辆排成了长龙，警察花了将近一个小时才使车辆又开起来。在这段时间里，卡车司机不得不清扫那几百只破瓶子。只有两只野狗从这一片混乱中得到了好处，它们贪婪地吃掉了剩下的蛋糕。这就是事事不顺心的那么一天！

    <p class="en">Antique shops exert a peculiar fascination on a great many people. The more expensive kind of
        antique
        shop where rare objects are beautifully displayed in glass cases to keep them free from dust is usually a
        forbidding
        place. But no one has to muster up courage to enter a less pretentious antique shop. There is always hope that
        in

        that
        litter the floors.</p>

        古玩店对许多人来说有一种特殊的魅力。高档一点的古玩店为了防尘，把文物漂亮地陈列在玻璃柜子里，那里往往令人望而却步。而对不太装腔作势的古玩店，无论是谁都不用壮着胆子才敢往里进。人们还常常有希望在发霉、阴暗、杂乱无章、迷宫般的店堂里，从杂乱地摆放在地面上的、一堆堆各式各样的破烂货里找到一件稀世珍品。

        the ability to recognize the worth of something when he sees it. To do this, he must be at least as

    <p class="cn">
        无论是谁都不会一下子就发现一件珍品。一个到处找便宜货买的人必须具有耐心，而且最重要的是看到珍品时要有鉴别珍品的能力。要做到这一点，他至少要像古董商一样在行。他必须像一个专心致志进行探索的科学家那样抱有这样的希望，即终有一天，他的努力会取得丰硕的成果。

    <p class="en">My old friend, Frank Halliday, is just such a person. He has often described to me how he picked up
        a
        masterpiece for a mere￡50. One Saturday morning, Frank visited an antique shop in my neighbourhood. As he had
        never
        been there before, he found a great deal to interest him. The morning passed rapidly and Frank was about to
        leave
        when he noticed a large packing-case lying on the floor. The dealer told him that it had just come in, but that
        he
        could not be bothered to open it. Frank begged him to do so and the dealer reluctantly prised it open. The
        contents
        were disappointing. Apart from an interesting-looking carved dagger, the box was full of crockery, much of it
        broken. Frank gently lifted the crockery out of the box and suddenly noticed a miniature painting at the bottom
        of
        the packing-case. As its Composition and line reminded him of an Italian painting he knew well, he decided to
        buy
        it. Glancing at it briefly, the dealer told him that it was worth￡50. Frank could hardly conceal his excitement,
        for
        he knew that he had made a real discovery. The tiny painting proved to be an unknown masterpiece by Correggio
        and
        was worth hundreds of thousands of pounds.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        我的老朋友弗兰克-哈利戴正是这样一个人。他多次向我详细讲他如何只花50英镑便买到一位名家的杰作。一个星期六的上午，弗兰克去了我家附近的一家古玩店。由于他从未去过那儿，结果他发现了许多有趣的东西。上午很快过去了，弗兰克正准备离去，突然看见地板上放着一只体积很大的货箱。古董商告诉他那只货箱刚到不久，但他嫌麻烦不想把它打开。经弗兰克恳求，古董商才勉强把货箱撬开了。箱内东西令人失望。除了一柄式样别致、雕有花纹的匕首外，货箱内装满了陶器，而且大部分都已破碎。弗兰克轻轻地把陶器拿出箱子，突然发现在箱底有一幅微型画，画面构图与线条使他想起了一幅他所熟悉的意大利画，于是他决定将画买下来。古董商漫不经心看了一眼那幅画，告诉弗兰克那画值50英镑。弗兰克几乎无法掩饰自己兴奋的心情，因为他明白自己发现了一件珍品。那幅不大的画原来是柯勒乔的一幅未被发现的杰作，价值几十万英镑。

    <p class="en">Future historians will be in a unique position when they come to record the history of our own
        times.
        They will hardly know which facts to select from the great mass of evidence that steadily accumulates. What is
        more,
        they will not have to rely solely on the written word. Films, videos, CDs and CD-ROMS are just some of the
        bewildering amount of information they will have. They will be able, as it were, to see and hear us in action.
        But
        the historian attempting to reconstruct the distant past is always faced with a difficult task. He has to deduce
        what he can from the few scanty clues available. Even seemingly insignificant remains can shed interesting light
        on
        the history of early man.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        未来的历史学家在写我们这一段历史的时候会别具一格。对于逐渐积累起来的庞大材料，他们几乎不知道选取哪些好，而且，也不必完全依赖文字材料。电影、录像、光盘和光盘驱动器只是能为他们提供令人眼花缭乱的大量信息的几种手段。他们能够身临其境般地观看我们做事，倾听我们讲话。但是，历史学家企图重现遥远的过去可是一项艰巨的任务，他们必须根据现有的不充分的线索进行推理。即使看起来微不足道的遗物，也可能揭示人类早期历史的一些有趣的内容。
    </p>
    <p class="en">Up to now, historians have assumed that calendars came into being with the advent of agriculture,
        for
        then man was faced with a real need to understand something about the seasons. Recent scientific evidence seems
        to
        indicate that this assumption is incorrect.</p>
    <p class="cn">历史学家迄今认为日历是随农业的问世而出现的，因为当时人们面临着了解四季的实际需要，但近期科学研究发现，好像这种假设是不正确的。</p>
    <p class="en">Historians have long been puzzled by dots, lines and symbols which have been engraved on walls,
        bones,
        and the ivory tusks of mammoths. The nomads who made these markings lived by hunting and fishing during the last
        Ice
        Age which began about 35,000 B.C. and ended about 10,000 B.C. By correlating markings made in various parts of
        the
        world, historians have been able to read this difficult code. They have found that it is connected with the
        passage
        of days and the phases of the moon. It is, in fact, a primitive type of calendar. It has long been known that
        the
        hunting scenes depicted on walls were not simply a form of artistic expression. They had a definite meaning, for
        they were as near as early man could get to writing. It is possible that there is a definite relation between
        these
        paintings and the markings that sometimes accompany them. It seems that man was making a real effort to
        understand
        the seasons 20,000 years earlier than has been supposed.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        长期以来，历史学家一直对雕刻在墙壁上、骨头上、古代长毛象的象牙上的点、线和形形色色的符号感到困惑不解。这些痕迹是游牧人留下的，他们生活在从公元前约35，000年到公元前10，000年的冰川期的末期，以狩猎、捕鱼为生。历史学家通过把世界各地留下的这种痕迹放在一起研究，终于弄懂了这种费解的代码。他们发现代码与昼夜更迭和月亮圆缺有关，事实上是一种最原始的日历。大家早就知道，画在墙上的狩猎图景并不是单纯的艺术表现形式，它们有着一定的含义，因为它们已接近古代人的文字形式。有时，这种图画与墙壁上的刻痕共存，它们之间可能有一定的联系。看来人类早就致力于探索四季变迁了，比人们想象的要早20,000年。

        Students specialize in a particular type of practical joke: the hoax. Inviting the fire-brigade to put out a

    <p class="en">When a student recently saw two workmen using a pneumatic drill outside his university, he
        immediately
        telephoned the police and informed them that two students dressed up as workmen were tearing up the road with a
        pneumatic drill. As soon as he had hung up, he went over to the workmen and told them that if a policeman
        ordered
        them to go away, they were not to take him seriously. He added that a student had dressed up as a policeman and
        was
        playing all sorts of silly jokes on people. Both the police and the workmen were grateful to the student for
        this
        piece of advance information.</p>

        a policeman arrived on the scene and politely asked the workmen to go away. When he received a very rude reply
        from
        one of the workmen, he threatened to remove them by force. The workmen told him to do as he pleased and the
        policeman telephoned for help. Shortly afterwards, four more policemen arrived and remonstrated with the
        workmen. As
        the men refused to stop working, the police attempted to seize the pneumatic drill. The workmen struggled

        and one of them lost his temper. He threatened to call the police. At this, the police pointed out ironically
        that
        this would hardly be necessary as the men were already under arrest. Pretending to speak seriously, one of the
        workmen asked if he might make a telephone call before being taken to the station. Permission was granted and a

        realize that they had all been the victims of a hoax.</p>

    <p class="title">Lesson 41 Illusions of Pastoral Peace 宁静田园生活的遐想</p>
    <p class="en">The quiet life of the country has never appealed to me. City born and city bred, I have always
        regarded
        the country as something you look at through a train window, or something you occasionally visit during the
        weekend.
        Most of my friends live in the city, yet they always go into raptures at the mere mention of the country. Though
        they extol the virtues of the peaceful life, only one of them has ever gone to live in the country and he was
        back
        in town within six months. Even he still lives under the illusion that country life is somehow superior to town
        life. He is forever talking about the friendly people, the clean atmosphere, the closeness to nature and the
        gentle
        pace of living. Nothing can be compared, he maintains, with the first cock crow, the twittering of birds at
        dawn,
        the sight of the rising sun glinting on the trees and pastures. This idyllic pastoral scene is only part of the
        picture. My friend fails to mention the long and friendless winter evenings in front of the TV ---- virtually
        the
        only form of entertainment. He says nothing about the poor selection of goods in the shops, or about those
        unfortunate people who have to travel from the country to the city every day to get to work. Why people are
        prepared
        to tolerate a four-hour journey each day for the dubious privilege of living in the country is beyond me. They
        could
        be saved so much misery and expense if they chose to live in the city where they rightly belong.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        宁静的乡村生活从来没有吸引过我。我生在城市，长在城市，总认为乡村是透过火车车窗看到的那个样子，或偶尔周末去游玩一下的景象。我的许多朋友都住在城市，但他们只要一提起乡村，马上就会变得欣喜若狂。尽管他们都交口称赞宁静的乡村生活的种种优点，但其中只有一人真去农村住过，而且不足6个月就回来了。即使他也仍存有幻觉，好像乡村生活就是比城市生活优越。他滔滔不绝地大谈友好的农民，洁净的空气，贴近大自然的环境和悠闲的生活节奏。他坚持认为，凌晨雄鸡第一声啼叫，黎明时分小鸟吱喳欢叫，冉冉升起的朝阳染红树木、牧场，此番美景无与伦比。但这种田园诗般的乡村风光仅仅是一个侧面。我的朋友没有提到在电视机前度过的漫长寂寞的冬夜——电视是唯一的娱乐形式。他也不说商店货物品种单调，以及那些每天不得不从乡下赶到城里工作的不幸的人们。人们为什么情愿每天在路上奔波4个小时去换取值得怀疑的乡间的优点，我是无法理解的。要是他们愿意住在本来属于他们的城市，则可以让他们省去诸多不便与节约大量开支。
    </p>
    <p class="en">If you can do without the few pastoral pleasures of the country, you will find the city can provide
        you
        with the best that life can offer. You never have to travel miles to see your friends. They invariably live
        nearby
        and are always available for an informal chat or an evening's entertainment. Some of my acquaintances in the
        country
        come up to town once or twice a year to visit the theatre as a special treat. For them this is a major operation
        which involves considerable planning. As the play draws to its close, they wonder whether they will ever catch
        that
        last train home. The city dweller never experiences anxieties of this sort. The latest exhibitions, films, or
        plays
        are only a short bus ride away. Shopping, too, is always a pleasure. There is so much variety that you never
        have to
        make do with second best. Country people run wild when they go shopping in the city and stagger home loaded with
        as
        many of the exotic items as they can carry. Nor is the city without its moments of beauty. There is something
        comforting about the warm glow shed by advertisements on cold wet winter nights. Few things could be more
        impressive
        than the peace that descends on deserted city streets at weekends when the thousands that travel to work every
        day
        are tucked away in their homes in the country. It has always been a mystery to me why city dwellers, who
        appreciate
        all these things, obstinately pretend that they would prefer to live in the country.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        如果你愿舍弃乡下生活那一点点乐趣的话，那么你会发现城市可以为你提供生活中最美好的东西。你去看朋友根本不用跋涉好几英里，因为他们都住在附近，你随时可以同他们聊天或在晚上一起娱乐。我在乡村有一些熟人，他们每年进城来看一回或几回戏，并把此看作一种特殊的享受。看戏在他们是件大事，需要精心计划。当戏快演完时，他们又为是否能赶上末班火车回家而犯愁。这种焦虑，城里人是从未体验过的。坐公共汽车几站路，就可看到最新的展览、电影、戏剧。买东西也是一种乐趣。物品品种繁多，从来不必用二等品来凑合。乡里人进城采购欣喜若狂，每次回家时都买足了外来商品，直到拿不动方才罢休，连走路都摇摇晃晃的。城市也并非没有良辰美景。寒冷潮湿的冬夜里，广告灯箱发出的暖光，会给人某种安慰。周末，当成千上万进城上班的人回到了他们的乡间寓所之后，空旷的街市笼罩着一种宁静的气氛，没有什么能比此时的宁静更令人难忘了。城里人对这一切心里很明白，却偏要执拗地装出他们喜欢住在乡村的样子，这对我来说一直是个谜。

    <p class="title">Lesson 42 Modern cavemen 现代洞穴人</p>
    <p class="en">Cave exploration, or pot-holing, as it has come to be known, is a relatively new sport. Perhaps it
        is
        the
        desire for solitude or the chance of making an unexpected discovery that lures people down to the depths of the
        earth. It is impossible to give a satisfactory explanation for a pot-holer's motives. For him, caves have the
        same
        peculiar fascination which high mountains have for the climber. They arouse instincts which can only be dimly
        understood.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        洞穴勘查——或洞穴勘探——是一项比较新的体育活动。寻求独处的愿望或寻求意外发现的机会的欲望吸引人们来到地下深处。要想对洞穴探险者的动机做出满意的解释是不可能的。对洞穴探险者来说，洞穴有一种特殊的魅力，就像高山对登山者有特殊魅力一样。为什么洞空能引发人的那种探险本能，人们对此只能有一种模模糊糊的理解。
    </p>
    <p class="en">Exploring really deep caves is not a task for the Sunday afternoon rambler. Such undertakings
        require
        the
        precise planning and foresight of military operations. It can take as long as eight days to rig up rope ladders
        and
        to establish supply bases before a descent can be made into a very deep cave. Precautions of this sort are
        necessary, for it is impossible to foretell the exact nature of the difficulties which will confront the
        pot-holer.
        The deepest known cave in the world is the Gouffre Berger near Grenoble. It extends to a depth of 3,723 feet.
        This
        immense chasm has been formed by an underground stream which has tunneled a course through a flaw in the rocks.
        The
        entrance to the cave is on a plateau in the Dauphine Alps. As it is only six feet across, it is barely
        noticeable.
        The cave might never have been discovered had not the entrance been spotted by the distinguished French
        pot-holer,
        Berger. Since its discovery, it has become a sort of pot-holers' Everest(珠峰). Though a number of descents have
        been
        made, much of it still remains to be explored.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        探测非常深的洞穴不是那些在星期日下午漫步的人所能胜任的。这种活动需要有军事行动般的周密部署和预见能力。有时需要花费整整8天时间来搭起绳梯，建立供应基地，然后才能到一个很深的洞穴里。做出这样的准备是必要的，因为无法预见到洞穴探险者究竟会遇到什么性质的困难。世界上最深的洞穴是格里诺布尔附近的高弗.伯杰洞，深达3,723英尺。这个深邃的洞穴是由一条地下暗泉冲刷岩石中的缝隙并使之慢慢变大而形成的。此洞的洞口在丹芬阿尔卑斯山的高原上，仅6英尺宽，很难被发现。若不是法国著名洞穴探险家伯杰由于偶然的机会发现了这个洞口的话，这个洞也许不会为人所知。自从被发现以后，这个洞成了洞穴探险者的珠穆朗玛峰，人们多次进入洞内探险，但至今尚有不少东西有待勘探。
    </p>
    <p class="en">A team of pot-holers recently went down the Gouffre Berger. After entering the narrow gap on the
        plateau,
        they climbed down the steep sides of the cave until they came to narrow corridor. They had to edge their way
        along
        this, sometimes wading across shallow streams, or swimming across deep pools. Suddenly they came to a waterfall
        which dropped into an underground lake at the bottom of the cave. They plunged into the lake, and after loading
        their gear on an inflatable rubber dinghy, let the current carry them to the other side. To protect themselves
        from
        the icy water, they had to wear special rubber suits. At the far end of the lake, they came to huge piles of
        rubble
        which had been washed up by the water. In this part of the cave, they could hear an insistent booming sound
        which
        they found was caused by a small water-spout shooting down into a pool from the roof of the cave. Squeezing
        through
        a cleft in the rocks, the pot-holers arrived at an enormous cavern, the size of a huge concert hall. After
        switching
        on powerful arc lights, they saw great stalagmites -- some of them over forty feet high -- rising up like
        tree-trunks to meet the stalactites suspended from the roof. Round about, piles of limestone glistened in all
        the
        colours of the rainbow. In the eerie（可怕的） silence of the cavern, the only sound that could be heard was made by
        water which dripped continuously from the high dome above them.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        最近，一队洞穴探险者下到了高弗.伯杰洞里。他们从高原上的窄缝进去，顺着笔直陡峭的洞壁往下爬。来到一条狭窄的走廊上。他们不得不侧着身子往前走，有时过浅溪，有时游过深潭。突然，他们来到一道瀑布前，那瀑布奔泻而下，注入洞底一处地下湖里。他们跳入湖中，把各种器具装上一只充气的橡皮艇，听任水流将他们带往对岸。湖水冰冷刺骨，他们必须穿上一种特制的橡皮服以保护自己。在湖的尽头，他们见到一大堆一大堆由湖水冲刷上岸的碎石。在这儿，他们可以听见一种连续不断的轰鸣声。后来他们发现这是由山洞顶部的一个小孔里喷出的水柱跌落到水潭中发出的声音。洞穴探险者从岩石缝里挤身过去，来到一个巨大的洞里，其大小相当于一个音乐厅。他们打开强力弧光灯，看见一株株巨大的石笋，有的高达40英尺，像树干似地向上长着，与洞顶悬挂下来的钟乳石相接。周围是一堆堆石灰石，像彩虹一样闪闪发光。洞里有一种可怕的寂静，唯一的可以听见的声响是高高的圆顶上不间断地滴水的嘀嗒声。

    <p class="title">Lesson 43 Fully insured 全保险</p>
    <p class="en">Insurance companies are normally willing to insure anything. Insuring public or private property is
        a
        standard practice in most countries in the world. If, however, you were holding an open air garden party or a
        fete
        it would be equally possible to insure yourself in the event of bad weather. Needless to say, the bigger the
        risk an
        insurance company takes, the higher the premium you will have to pay. It is not uncommon to hear that a shipping
        company has made a claim for the cost of salvaging a sunken ship. But the claim made by a local authority to
        recover
        the cost of salvaging a sunken pie dish must surely be unique.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        保险公司一般说来愿意承保一切东西。承办公共财产或私人财产保险是世界上大部分国家的正常业务。如果你要举办一次露天游园会或盛宴，为避免碰上不好的天气而遭受损失也同样可以保险。不用说，保险公司承担风险越大，你付的保险费也就越高。航运公司为打捞沉船而提出索赔，这是常有的事，但某地当局为打捞一只焙制馅饼的盘子提出索赔，倒是件新鲜事儿。
    </p>
    <p class="en">Admittedly it was an unusual pie dish, for it was eighteen feet long and six feet wide. It had been
        purchased by a local authority so that an enormous pie could be baked for an annual fair. The pie committee
        decided
        that the best way to transport the dish would be by canal, so they insured it for the trip. Shortly after it was
        launched, the pie committee went to a local inn to celebrate. At the same time, a number of teenagers climbed on
        to
        the dish and held a little party of their own. Dancing proved to be more than the dish could bear, for during
        the
        party it capsized and sank in seven feet of water.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        这个馅饼盘子确实少见，有18英尺长，6英尺宽。某地方当局买下它用来焙制一个巨大的馅饼为一年一度交易会助兴。馅饼委员会确认运输这只盘子的最佳方案是通过运河水运。于是，他们对这只盘子的运输安全投了保。盘子下水后不久，馅饼委员会成员们来到当地一家小酒店庆贺。就在这个时候，许多十几岁的孩子爬上盘子举行他们自己的集会。他们跳起了舞，盘子难以承受。舞会进行过程中，盘子倾覆，沉入了7英尺深的水中。
    </p>
    <p class="en">The pie committee telephoned a local garage owner who arrived in a recovery truck to salvage the pie
        dish. Shivering in their wet clothes, the teenagers looked on while three men dived repeatedly into the water to
        locate the dish. They had little difficulty in finding it, but hauling it out of the water proved to be a
        serious
        problem. The sides of the dish were so smooth that it was almost impossible to attach hawsers and chains to the
        rim
        without damaging it. Eventually chains were fixed to one end of the dish and a powerful winch was put into
        operation. The dish rose to the surface and was gently drawn towards the canal bank. For one agonizing moment,
        the
        dish was perched precariously on the bank of the canal, but it suddenly overbalanced and slid back into the
        water.
        The men were now obliged to try once more. This time they fixed heavy metal clamps to both sides of the dish so
        that
        they could fasten the chains. The dish now had to be lifted vertically because one edge was resting against the
        side
        of the canal. The winch was again put into operation and one of the men started up the truck. Several minutes
        later,
        the dish was successfully hauled above the surface of the water. Water streamed in torrents over its sides with
        such
        force that it set up a huge wave in the canal. There was a danger that the wave would rebound off the other side
        of
        the bank and send the dish plunging into the water again. By working at tremendous speed, the men managed to get
        the
        dish on to dry land before the wave returned.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        馅饼委员会给当地汽车修理库老板打电话，他闻讯后开着一辆急修车前来打捞盘子。那些孩子们穿着湿衣服哆嗦，看着3个工人轮番潜入水中以确定盘子的位置。他们没费多大事儿就找到了盘子，可是把盘子捞出却是一个很大的难题。盘子四边十分光滑，要在盘边拴上绳索或链条而同时又不损坏它是很难办到的。不过，他们终于将链条固定在盘子的一端，一台大功率的绞车开动起来。盘子慢慢浮出水面，被轻轻地拽向运河岸边。在令人忐忑不安的瞬间，盘子晃晃悠悠地上了岸，但它突然失去了平衡，又跌回水中。工人们只得再来一次。这次，他们用沉重的金属夹子把盘子夹住，以便往盘子上安装铁链。这次，盘子必须垂直吊出水面，因为盘子的一边紧靠着运河河岸。绞盘机再次启动，一位工人发动了急修车的引擎。几分钟后，盘子被成功地拽出了水面。波浪从盘子两侧急涌而出，在运河里掀起一股大浪。但是当波浪从河对岸折回来时，就有再次把盘子拖进水里的危险。工人们动作迅速，终于赶在那股大浪返回之前把盘子拽到了岸上。

    <p class="title">Lesson 44 Speed and comfort 又快捷又舒适</p>
    <p class="en">People, traveling long distances frequently have to decide whether they would prefer to go by land,
        sea,
        or air. Hardly anyone can positively enjoy sitting in a train for more than a few hours. Train compartments soon
        get
        cramped and stuffy. It is almost impossible to take your mind off the journey. Reading is only a partial
        solution,
        for the monotonous rhythm of the wheels clicking on the rails soon lulls you to sleep. During the day, sleep
        comes
        in snatches. At night, when you really wish to go to sleep, you rarely manage to do so. If you are lucky enough
        to
        get a sleeper, you spend half the night staring at the small blue light in the ceiling, or fumbling to find your
        ticket for inspection. Inevitably you arrive at your destination almost exhausted. Long car journeys are even
        less
        pleasant, for it is quite impossible even to read. On motorways you can, at least, travel fairly safely at high
        speeds, but more often than not, the greater part of the journey is spent on roads with few service stations and
        too
        much traffic. By comparison, ferry trips or cruises offer a great variety of civilized comforts. You can stretch
        your legs on the spacious decks, play games, meet interesting people and enjoy good food----always assuming, of
        course, that the sea is calm. If it is not, and you are likely to get sea-sick, no form of transport could be
        worse.
        Even if you travel in ideal weather, sea journeys take a long time. Relatively few people are prepared to
        sacrifice
        holiday time for the pleasure of travelling by sea.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        出远门的人常常需要决定是走旱路、水路，还是坐飞机。很少有人能够真正喜欢坐几个小时以上的火车。车厢很快就变得拥挤、闷热，想摆脱开旅途的困扰是很难的。看书只能解决部分问题。车轮与铁轨间单调的嘎喳声很快就会送你进入梦乡。白天是忽睡忽醒，到了夜晚，你真想睡了，却很难入睡。即使你走运弄到一个卧铺，夜间有一半时间你会盯着车顶那盏小蓝灯而睡不着觉；要不然就为查票摸索你的车票。一旦抵达目的地，你总是疲惫不堪。乘汽车作长途旅行则更加不舒服，因为连看书都几乎不可能。在公路上还好，你至少能以相当快的速度安全地向前行。但旅行的大部分时间都花在路上，而且只有很少的服务设施，交通也很拥挤。相比之下，坐船旅行或环游可以得到文明世界的各种享受。你可以在甲板上伸展四肢、做游戏，还能见到各种有趣的人，能享用各种美味佳肴——当然，这一切只有在大海风平浪静的情况下才有可能。如果大海肆虐起来，你就可能晕船，那种难受劲儿是任何一种别的旅行方式都不会带来的。即便风平浪静，坐船旅行也要占用很长时间。没有多少人会为了享受坐船旅行的乐趣而牺牲假期的时间。

    <p class="en">Aeroplanes have the reputation of being dangerous and even hardened travellers are intimidated by
        them.
        They also have the disadvantage of being an expensive form of transport. But nothing can match them for speed
        and
        comfort. Travelling at a height of 30, 000 feet, far above the clouds, and at over 500 miles an hour is an
        exhilarating experience. You do not have to devise ways of taking your mind off the journey, for an aeroplane
        gets
        you to your destination rapidly. For a few hours, you settle back in a deep armchair to enjoy the flight. The
        real
        escapist can watch a film and sip champagne on some services. But even when such refinements are not available,
        there is plenty to keep you occupied. An aeroplane offers you an unusual and breathtaking view of the world. You
        soar effortlessly over high mountains and deep valleys. You really see the shape of the land. If the landscape
        is
        hidden from view, you can enjoy the extraordinary sight of unbroken cloud plains that stretch out for miles
        before
        you, while the sun shines brilliantly in a clear sky. The journey is so smooth that there is nothing to prevent
        you
        from reading or sleeping. However you decide to spend your time, one thing is certain: you will arrive at your
        destination fresh and uncrumpled. You will not have to spend the next few days recovering from a long and
        arduous
        journey.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        飞机以危险而著称，连老资格的旅行者也怕飞机。飞机的另一个缺点是昂贵。但就速度与舒适而言，飞机是无与伦比的。腾云驾雾，在3万英尺高空以500英里的时速旅行，这种经历令人心旷神怡。你不必想办法去摆脱旅途的困扰，因为飞机会迅速地把你送到目的地。几小时之内，你躺在扶手椅上，享受着旅途的欢乐。真正会享受的人还可以在某些航班上看一场电影和喝香槟。即使没有这些消遣条件，也总是有事可做。飞机上，你可以观察世界上非同寻常的奇妙的美景。你毫不费劲地飞越高山幽谷，你确能饱览大地的风貌。如果这种景色被遮住了，你便可以观赏一下展现在你面前的、一望数英里的、连绵不断的云海，同时阳光灿烂，天空清澈明朗。旅途平稳，丝毫不妨碍你阅读或睡眠。不管你打算如何消磨时间，有件事是可以肯定的，即当你抵达目的地时，你感到精神焕发，毫无倦意，用不着因为漫长旅途的辛苦而花几天时间休息来恢复精神。

    <p class="title">Lesson 45 The power of the press 新闻报道的威力</p>
    <p class="en">In democratic countries any efforts to restrict the freedom of the Press are rightly condemned.
        However,
        this freedom can easily be abused. Stories about people often attract far more public attention than political
        events. Though we may enjoy reading about the lives of others, it is extremely doubtful whether we would equally
        enjoy reading about ourselves. Acting on the contention that facts are sacred, reporters can cause untold
        suffering
        to individuals by publishing details about their private lives. Newspapers exert such tremendous influence that
        they
        can not only bring about major changes to the lives of ordinary people but can even overthrow a government.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        在民主国家里，任何限制新闻自由的企图都理所当然地受到谴责。然而，这种自由很容易被滥用。常人轶事往往比政治事件更能引起公众注意。我们都喜欢看关于别人生活的报道，但是否同样喜欢看关于自己生活的报道，就很难说了。记者按事实至上的论点行事，发表有关别人私生活的细节，有时会给当事人造成极大的痛苦。新闻具有巨大的威力。它们不仅可以给寻常人家的生活带来重大的变化，甚至还能推翻一个政府。
    </p>
    <p class="en">The story of a poor family that acquired fame and fortune overnight, dramatically illustrates the
        power
        of the press. The family lived in Aberdeen, a small town of 23, 000 inhabitants in South Dakota. As the parents
        had
        five children, life was a perpetual struggle against poverty. They were expecting their sixth child and were
        faced
        with even more pressing economic problems. If they had only had one more child, the fact would have passed
        unnoticed. They would have continued to struggle against economic odds and would have lived in obscurity. But
        they
        suddenly became the parents of quintuplets, four girls and a boy, an event which radically changed their lives.
        The
        day after the birth of the five children, an aeroplane arrived in Aberdeen bringing sixty reporters and
        photographers.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        下面这户穷人一夜之间出名发财的故事戏剧性地说明了新闻报道的威力。这户人家住在南达科他州一个人口为23，000的小镇上，镇名为阿拜丁。家里已有5个孩子，全家人常年在贫困中挣扎。第6个孩子即将问世，他们面临着更为严峻的经济问题。如果他们只是添了1个孩子，这件事本来就不会引起任何人的注意。这家人会继续为克服经济上的拮据而奋斗，并默默无闻地活下去。但是他们出人意料地生了个五胞胎，4女1男。这事使他们的生活发生了根本的变化。五胞胎降生第二天，一架飞机飞抵阿拜丁，随机带来60名记者与摄影师。
    </p>
    <p class="en">The rise to fame was swift. Television cameras and newspapers carried the news to everyone in the
        country. Newspapers and magazines offered the family huge sums for the exclusive rights to publish stories and
        photographs. Gifts poured in not only from unknown people, but from baby food and soap manufacturers who wished
        to
        advertise their products. The old farmhouse the family lived in was to be replaced by a new ＄500, 000 home.
        Reporters kept pressing for interviews so lawyers had to be employed to act as spokesmen for the family at press
        conferences. While the five babies were still quietly sleeping in oxygen tents in a hospital nursery, their
        parents
        were paying the price for fame. It would never again be possible for them to lead normal lives. They had become
        the
        victims of commercialization, for their names had acquired a market value. Instead of being five new family
        members,
        these children had immediately become a commodity.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        这一家迅速出了名。电视摄像机和报纸把消息传送到全国。报纸、杂志出高价向他们购买文字、图片的独家报道权。不但素昧平生的人寄来了大量的礼物，而且婴儿食品、婴儿肥皂制造厂商为了替自己产品做广告也寄来了大量的礼物。这家人住的旧农舍将由一座价值50万美元的新住宅所取代。由于记者纷纷要求会见，他们不得不请了律师充当他们家的发言人举行记者招待会。眼下，五胞胎还静静地躺在医院婴儿室的氧气帐里，他们的父母却为这名声付出了代价，他们再也无法过正常的生活。他们成了商业化的受害者，因为他们的名字具有了市场价值。这些孩子立即成了商品，而不是5个新的家庭成员。

    <p class="title">Lesson 47 Too high a price? 代价太高？</p>
    <p class="en">Pollution is the price we pay for an overpopulated, over industrialized planet. When you come to
        think
        about it, there are only four ways you can deal with rubbish: dump it, burn it, turn it into something you can
        use
        again, attempt to produce less of it. We keep trying all four methods, but he sheer volume of rubbish we produce
        worldwide threatens to overwhelm us.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        污染就是我们为这个人口过密，过度工业化的星球所付出的代价。当我们开始考虑垃圾问题时，我们只有4种对付垃圾的方法：倾倒、焚烧、把垃圾变成再生材料或试图少产生一些垃圾。我们一直在试这4种方式，但是，我们在世界范围内仅产生的垃圾的量就有把我们覆盖的危险。
    </p>
    <p class="en">Rubbish, however, is only part of the problem of polluting our planet. The need to produce
        ever-increasing quantities of cheap food leads to a different kind of pollution. Industrialized farming methods
        produce cheap meat products: beef, pork and chicken. The use of pesticides and fertilizers produces cheap grain
        and
        vegetables. The price we pay for cheap food may be already too high: Mad Cow Disease (BSE) in cattle, salmonella
        in
        chicken and eggs, and wisteria in dairy products. And if you think you'll abandon meat and become a vegetarian,
        you
        have the choice of very expensive organically-grown vegetables or a steady diet of pesticides every time you
        think
        you're eating fresh salads and vegetables, or just having an innocent glass of water!</p>
    <p class="cn">
        然而，垃圾只是我们这个星球的污染问题的一个方面。日益增长的对廉价食物的需求导致了另一种形式的污染。工业化的农作方式生产出廉价的肉类制品——牛肉、猪肉和鸡肉。使用杀虫剂和化肥生产出廉价的谷物和蔬菜。为了廉价食物我们付出代价已经太高了：牛肉中的疯牛病，鸡肉和鸡蛋中的沙门氏菌，奶制品中的利斯特杆菌。如果你想放弃肉类而变成一位素食者，那么你可以两者择一：或是选用价格昂贵、有机培植的蔬菜，或是当你认为在享用新鲜色拉和新鲜蔬菜或饮用一杯无害的水的时候，实际上每次都不断吃进杀虫剂。
    </p>
    <p class="en">However, there is an even more insidious kind of pollution that particularly affects urban areas and
        invades our daily lives, and that is noise. Burglar alarms going off at any time of the day or night serve only
        to
        annoy passers-by and actually assist burglars to burgle. Car alarms constantly scream at us in the street and
        are a
        source of profound irritation. A recent survey of the effects of noise revealed (surprisingly?) that dogs
        barking
        incessantly in the night rated the highest form of noise pollution on a scale ranging from 1 to 7. The survey
        revealed a large number of sources of noise that we really dislike. Lawn mowers whining on a summer's day,
        late-night parties in apartment blocks, noisy neighbors, vehicles of al kinds, especially large container trucks
        thundering through quiet village, planes and helicopters flying overhead, large radios carried round in public
        places and played at maximum volume. New technology has also made its own contribution to noise. A lot of people
        object to mobile phones, especially when they are used in public places like restaurants or on public transport.
        Loud conversations on mobile phones invade our thoughts or interrupt the pleasure of meeting friends for a quiet
        chat. The noise pollution survey revealed a rather spurring and possibly amusing old fashioned source of noise.
        It
        turned out to be snoring! Men were found to be the worst offenders. It was revealed that 20% of men in their
        mid-thirties snore. This figure rises to a staggering 60% of men in their sixties. Against these figures, it was
        found that only 5% of women snore regularly, while the rest are constantly woken or kept awake by their
        trumpeting
        partners. Whatever the source of noise, one thing is certain: silence, it seems, has become a golden memory.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        但是，还有一种更加隐蔽有害的污染，它专门影响城镇地区，侵袭我们的日常生活，那就是噪音。防盗警报器在白天和黑夜的任何时候都会响起来，它的作用只是骚扰过路行人，而实际上却帮助窃贼入室行窃。在街上，汽车的防盗警报不断对我们吼叫，这是人们极度烦躁的一个原因，最近一个有关噪音的作用的调查（令人吃惊地）指出，夜间连续不断的狗叫声，在一个从1级至7级刻度表上应列为最严重的噪音污染。这个调查揭示了我们所不喜欢的大量的噪音的来源：夏天呜呜作响的割草机，公寓楼里深夜聚会的喧哗声，大声吵闹的邻居，各式各样的车辆，特别是穿越寂静的村庄的集装箱卡车，从头顶飞过的飞机和直升机，被带到公共场所、音量开到最大的大功率收音机。新技术也为噪音作了它的贡献。许多人都反对移动式电话，特别是在如饭店，公共交通车等公共场所使用移动电话。用移动电话大声交谈干扰我们的思路，破坏我们和朋友在一起轻声聊天所得到的乐趣。这个有关噪音的污染调查还揭示了一种出人意外而同时可能会引人意外而同时可能会引人发笑的老式噪音源。它竟然是鼾声。人类是这方面的罪魁祸首。调查指出，20%的35岁左右的男人打鼾；而到60岁这个年龄段，这个数字上升到令人惊愕的60%。与这些数字相比，只有5%
        的女性经常打鼾；而其余则经常被与她们同睡、像吹号似地打着呼噜的男人吵醒或弄得睡不着。不管噪声来自何方，有一点是肯定的：看来寂静已变成一种珍贵的回忆。</p>

    <p class="title">Lesson 50 New Year resolutions 新年的决心</p>
    <p class="en">The New Year is a time for resolutions. Mentally, at least, most of us could compile formidable
        lists
        of
        ‘dos’ and ‘don'ts’. The same old favourites recur year in year out with monotonous regularity. We resolve to get
        up
        earlier each morning, eat less, find more time to play with the children, do a thousand and one jobs about the
        house, be nice to people we don't like, drive carefully, and take the dog for a walk every day. Past experience
        has
        taught us that certain accomplishments are beyond attainment. If we remain inveterate smokers, it is only
        because we
        have so often experienced the frustration that results from failure. Most of us fail in our efforts at
        self-improvement because our schemes are too ambitious and we never have time to carry them out. We also make
        the
        fundamental error of announcing our resolutions to everybody so that we look even more foolish when we slip back
        into our bad old ways. Aware of these pitfalls, this year I attempted to keep my resolutions to myself. I
        limited
        myself to two modest ambitions: to do physical exercises every morning and to read more of an evening. An
        all-night
        party on New Year's Eve provided me with a good excuse for not carrying on either of these new resolutions on
        the
        first day of the year, but on the second, I applied myself assiduously to the task.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        新年是下决心的时候，至少在大多数人的心里会编排出一份“应做什么”和“不应做什么”的令人生畏的单子。相同的决心以单调的规律年复一年地出现。我们决心每天早晨起得早些；吃得少些；多花点时间与孩子们一起做游戏；做大量的家务；对不喜欢的人友善一些；小心驾车；每天都要带着狗散步；等等。以往的经验告诉我们有些事是办不到的。如果我们烟瘾大，戒不掉，那是因为屡戒屡败，失去了信心。我们大多数人想自我完善却遭到失败，这是因为我们的规划过于宏大，而又根本没有时间去实施。我们还犯有一个根本性的错误，即把我们的决心向大家宣布。这样一旦滑回到那些环的老习惯上去，我们在别人眼里会显得更加难堪。我深知这些问题，于是，今年我对自己的计划要严加保密，只给自己定下两项适中的任务：每天早上锻炼身体，每天晚上多看点书。新年除夕举办的一次通宵晚会，使我理直气壮地在新年头一天免去了这两项任务。不过，新年第二天，我全力以赴地照着去做了。
    </p>
    <p class="en">The daily exercises lasted only eleven minutes and I proposed to do them early in the morning before
        anyone had got up. The self-discipline required to drag myself out of bed eleven minutes earlier than usual was
        considerable. Nevertheless, I managed to creep down into the living-room for two days before anyone found me
        out.
        After jumping about on the carpet and twisting the human frame into uncomfortable positions, I sat down at the
        breakfast table in an exhausted condition. It was this that betrayed me. The next morning the whole family
        trooped
        in to watch the performance. That was really unsettling, but I fended off the taunts and jibes of the family
        good-humouredly and soon everybody got used to the idea. However, my enthusiasm waned. The time I spent at
        exercise
        gradually diminished. Little by little the eleven minutes fell to zero. By January 10th, I was back to where I
        had
        started from. I argued that if I spent less time exhausting myself at exercises in the morning, I would keep my
        mind
        fresh for reading when I got home from work. Resisting the hypnotizing effect of television, I sat in my room
        for a
        few evenings with my eyes glued to a book. One night, however, feeling cold and lonely, I went downstairs and
        sat in
        front of the television pretending to read. That proved to be my undoing, for I soon got back to my old bad
        habit of
        dozing off in front of the screen. I still haven't given up my resolution to do more reading. In fact, I have
        just
        bought a book entitled How to Read a Thousand Words a Minute. Perhaps it will solve my problem, but I just
        haven't
        had time to read it!</p>
    <p class="cn">
        早锻炼一共只有11分钟，我打算在别人起床之前进行。这就要求我比平日早11分钟把自己从床上拽起来，这种自我约束是很艰苦的。不过开头两天我还是成功地蹑手蹑脚地来到楼下起居室，被谁也没发现。我在地毯上跳过来蹦过去，扭曲身子，摆出各种姿势，弄得浑身不舒服，然后坐到桌边吃早饭，一副筋疲力尽的样子。正是这副模样泄露了我的秘密。第二天早晨全家人结队来到起居室看我表演。这真叫人不好意思，但我心平气和地顶住了全家人的嘲笑和奚落。不久，大家对我习以为常了，而这时我的热情却减退了。我花在锻炼上的时间逐渐减少，慢慢地从11分钟减到了零。到了1月10日，我恢复了原来的作息时间。我辩解说，早晨少耗费精力锻炼，晚上下班回家看书时头脑更清醒些。有几天晚上，我极力摆脱了电视的诱惑，坐在自己房间里，两眼盯在书上。可是，有一天夜里，我感到又冷又孤单，便来到楼下坐在电视机前假装看书。这下我可完了，因为不一会儿，我就恢复了以前的坏习惯，在屏幕前打起瞌睡来。但我还没有放弃多看些书的决心。事实上，我刚买来一本叫《一分钟读一千字的诀窍》的书。也许这本书能解决我的问题，但我一直还没时间去看这本书！

    <p class="title">Lesson 53 In the public interest 为了公众的利益</p>
    <p class="en">The Scandinavian countries are much admired all over the world for their enlightened social
        policies.
        Sweden has evolved an excellent system for protecting the individual citizen from high-handed or incompetent
        public
        officers. The system has worked so well, that it has been adopted in other countries too.</p>
    <p class="cn">斯堪的纳维亚半岛各国实行的开明的社会政策，受到全世界的推崇。在瑞典，已逐渐形成了一种完善的制度以保护每个公民不受专横的和不称职的政府官员的欺压。由于这种制度行之有效，已被其他国家采纳。</p>
    <p class="en">The Swedes were the first to recognize that public officials like civil servants, police officers,
        health
        inspectors or tax-collectors can make mistakes or act over-zealously in the belief that they are serving the
        public.
        As long ago as 1809, the Swedish Parliament introduced a scheme to safeguard the interest of the individual. A
        parliamentary committee representing all political parties appoints a person who is suitably qualified to
        investigate private grievances against the State. The official title of the person is ‘Justiteombudsman’, but
        the
        Swedes commonly refer to him as the ‘J. O.’ or ‘Ombudsman’. The Ombudsman is not subject to political pressure.
        He
        investigates complaints large and small that come to him from all levels of society. As complaints must be made
        in
        writing, the Ombudsman receives an average of 1, 200 letters a year. He has eight lawyer assistants to help him
        and
        he examines every single letter in detail. There is nothing secretive about the Ombudsman's work, for his
        correspondence is open to public inspection. If a citizen's complaint is justified, the Ombudsman will act on
        his
        behalf. The action he takes varies according to the nature of the complaint. He may gently reprimand an official
        or
        even suggest to parliament that a law be altered. The following case is a typical example of the Ombudsman's
        work.
    </p>
    <p class="cn">
        是瑞典人首先认识到政府工作人员如文职人员、警官、卫生稽查员、税务人员等等也会犯错误或者自以为在为公众服务而把事情做过了头。早在1809年，瑞典议会就建立了一个保护公民利益的制度。议会内有一个代表各政党利益的委员会，由它委派一位称职的人选专门调查个人对国家的意见。此人官衔为“司法特派员”，但瑞典人一般都管他叫“J．O．”，即“司法特派员”。司法特派员不受任何政治压力的制约。他听取社会各阶层的各种大小意见，并进行调查。由于意见均需用书面形式提出，司法特派员每年平均收到1，200封信。他有8位律师做他的助手协助工作，每封信都详细批阅。司法特派员的工作没有什么秘密可言，他的信件是公开的，供公众监督。如果公民的意见正确，司法特派员便为他伸张正义。司法特派员采取的行动因意见的性质不同而有所不同。他可以善意地批评某位官员，也可以甚至向议会提议修改某项法律。下述事件是司法特派员工作的一个典型例子。
    </p>
    <p class="en">A foreigner living in a Swedish village wrote to the Ombudsman complaining that he had been
        ill-treated
        by the police, simply because he was a foreigner. The Ombudsman immediately wrote to the Chief of Police in the
        district asking him to send a record of the case. There was nothing in the record to show that the foreigner's
        complaint was justified and the Chief of Police strongly denied the accusation. It was impossible for the
        Ombudsman
        to take action, but when he received a similar complaint from another foreigner in the same village, he
        immediately
        sent one of his lawyers to investigate the matter. The lawyer ascertained that a policeman had indeed dealt
        roughly
        with foreigners on several occasions. The fact that the policeman was prejudiced against foreigners could not be
        recorded in the official files. It was only possible for the Ombudsman to find this out by sending one of his
        representatives to check the facts. The policeman in question was severely reprimanded and was informed that if
        any
        further complaints were lodged against him, he would be prosecuted. The Ombudsman's prompt action at once put an
        end
        to an unpleasant practice which might have gone unnoticed.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        一个住在瑞典乡村的外国人写信给司法特派员，抱怨说他受到警察虐待，原因就是因为他是个外国人。司法特派员立即写信给当地的警察局长，请他寄送与此事有关的材料。材料中没有任何文字记载证明外国人所说的情况符合事实，警察局长矢口否认这一指控。司法特派员难以处理。但是，当他又收到住在同一村庄的另一个外国人写的一封内容类似的投诉信时，他立即派出一位律师前去调查。律师证实有个警察确实多次粗鲁地对待外国人。警察歧视外国人的事在官方档案中不可能加以记载，司法特派员只有派他的代表去核对事实才能了解真相。当事的警察受到严厉斥责，并被告知，如果再有人投诉他，他将受到起诉。司法特派员及时采取的行动，迅速制止了这一起不愉快的事件，不然这件事可能因未得到人们注意而不了了之。

    <p class="title">Lesson 54 Instinct or cleverness? 是本能还是机智</p>
    <p class="en">We have been brought up to fear insects. We regard them as unnecessary creatures that do more harm
        than
        good. We continually wage war on them, for they contaminate our food, carry diseases, or devour our crops. They
        sting or bite without provocation; they fly uninvited into our rooms on summer nights, or beat ageist our
        lighted
        windows. We live in dread not only of unpleasant insects like spiders or wasps, but of quite harmless one like
        moths. Reading about them increases our understanding without dispelling our fears. Knowing that the industrious
        ant
        lives in a highly organized society does nothing to prevent us from being filled with revulsion when we find
        hordes
        of them crawling over a carefully prepared picnic lunch. No matter how much we like honey, or how much we have
        read
        about the uncanny sense of direction which bees possess, we have a horror of being stung. Most of our fears are
        unreasonable, but they are impossible to erase. At the same time, however, insects are strangely fascinating. We
        enjoy reading about them, especially when we find that, like the praying mantis, they lead perfectly horrible
        lives.
        We enjoy staring at them, entranced as they go about their business, unaware (we hope) of our presence. Who has
        not
        stood in awe at the sight of a spider pouncing on a fly, or a column of ants triumphantly bearing home an
        enormous
        dead beetle?</p>
    <p class="cn">
        我们自幼就在对昆虫的惧怕中长大。我们把昆虫当作害多益少的无用东西。人类不断同昆虫斗争，因为昆虫弄脏我们的食物，传播疾病，吞噬庄稼。它们无缘无故地又叮又咬；夏天的晚上，它们未经邀请便飞到我们房间里，或者对着露出亮光的窗户乱扑乱撞。我们在日常生活中，不但憎恶如蜘蛛、黄蜂之类令人讨厌的昆虫，而且憎恶并无大害的飞蛾等。阅读有关昆虫的书能增加我们对它们的了解，却不能消除我们的恐惧的心理。即使知道勤奋的蚂蚁生活具有高度组织性的社会里，当看到大群蚂蚁在我们精心准备的午间野餐上爬行时，我们也无法抑制对它们的反感。不管我们多么爱吃蜂蜜，或读过多少关于蜜蜂具有神秘的识别方向的灵感的书，我们仍然十分害怕被蜂蜇。我们的恐惧大部分是没有道理的，但去无法消除。同时，不知为什么昆虫又是迷人的。我们喜欢看有关昆虫的书，尤其是当我们了解螳螂等过着一种令人生畏的生活时，就更加爱读有关昆虫的书了。我们喜欢入迷地看它们做事，它们不知道（但愿如此）我们就在它们身边。当看到蜘蛛扑向一只苍蝇时，一队蚂蚁抬着一只巨大的死甲虫凯旋归时，谁能不感到敬畏呢？
    </p>
    <p class="en">Last summer I spent days in the garden watching thousands of ants crawling up the trunk of my prize
        peach
        tree. The tree has grown against a warm wall on a sheltered side of the house. I am especially proud of it, not
        only
        because it has survived several severe winters, but because it occasionally produces luscious peaches. During
        the
        summer, I noticed that the leaves of the tree were beginning to wither. Clusters of tiny insects called aphides
        were
        to be found on the underside of the leaves. They were visited by a large colony of ants which obtained a sort of
        honey from them. I immediately embarked on an experiment which, even though if failed to get rid of the ants,
        kept
        me fascinated for twenty-four hours. I bound the base of the tree with sticky tape, making it impossible for the
        ants to reach the aphides. The tape was so stick that they did not dare to cross it. For a long time. I watched
        them
        scurrying around the base of the tree in bewilderment. I even went out at midnight with a torch and noted with
        satisfaction (and surprise) that the ants were still swarming around the sticky tape without being able to do
        anything about it. I got up early next morning hoping to find that the ants had given up in despair. Instead, I
        saw
        that they had discovered a new route. They were climbing up the wall of the house and then on to the leaves of
        the
        tree. I realized sadly that I had been completely defeated by their ingenuity. The ants had been quick to find
        an
        answer to my thoroughly unscientific methods!</p>
    <p class="cn">
        去年夏天，我花了好几天时间站在花园里观察成千只蚂蚁爬上我那棵心爱的桃树的树干。那棵树是靠着房子有遮挡的一面暖墙生长的。我为这棵树感到特别自豪，不仅因为它度过了几个寒冬终于活了下来，而且还因为它有时结出些甘甜的桃子来。到了夏天，我发现树叶开始枯萎，结果在树叶背面找到成串的叫做蚜虫小虫子。蚜虫遭到一窝蚂蚁的攻击，蚂蚁从它们身上可以获得一种蜜。我当即动手作了一项试验，这项试验尽管没有使我摆脱这些蚂蚁，却使我着迷了24小时。我用一条胶带把桃树底部包上，不让蚂蚁接近蚜虫。胶带极粘，蚂蚁不敢从上面爬过。在很长一段时间里，我看见蚂蚁围着大树底部来回转悠，不知所措。半夜，我还拿着电筒来到花园里，满意地（同时惊奇地）发现那些蚂蚁还围着胶带团团转。无能为力。第二天早上，我起床后希望看见蚂蚁已因无望而放弃了尝试，结果却发现它们又找到一条新的路径。它们正在顺着房子的外墙往上爬，然后爬上树叶。我懊丧地感到败在了足智多谋的蚂蚁的手下。蚂蚁已很快找到了相应的对策，来对付我那套完全不科学的办法！

    <p class="title">Lesson 59 Collecting 收藏</p>
    <p class="en">People tend to amass possessions, sometimes without being aware of doing so. Indeed they can have a
        delightful surprise when they find something useful which they did not know they owned. Those who never have to
        move
        house become indiscriminate collectors of what can only be described as clutter. They leave unwanted objects in
        drawers, cupboards and attics for years, in the belief that they may one day need just those very things. As
        they
        grow old, people also accumulate belongings for two other reasons, lack of physical and mental energy, both of
        which
        are essential in turning out and throwing away, and sentiment. Things owned for a long time are full of
        associations
        with the past, perhaps with relatives who are dead, and so they gradually acquire a value beyond their true
        worth.

        人们喜欢收藏东西，有时并没有意识到自己在这样做。确实，一旦无意之中从自己的收藏品中找到某件有用的东西时，可以给人一种惊喜的感觉。那些从来不必搬家的人们成了一种无所不容的收藏家。他们专门收藏那些只能被称作杂货的东西。他们在抽屉里、碗柜中、阁楼上堆放着一些不用的东西，一放就是好几年，相信总有一天需要的正好是那些东西。人们年老之后也喜欢收藏东西，不过是出于两个不同的原因：一是体力、精力均告不佳，这二者是清除无用的东西必不可少的因素；另一个原因是感情因素。东西搁得时间久了，便会充满着与过去岁月的联系，比方说与死去的亲戚有关。因此这些东西慢慢获得了一种超出它本身的价值。

    <p class="en">Some things are collected deliberately in the home in an attempt to avoid waste. Among these I would
        list
        string and brown paper, kept by thrifty people when a parcel has been opened, to save buying these two
        requisites.
        Collecting small items can easily become a mania. I know someone who always cuts sketches out from newspapers of
        model clothes that she would like to buy, if she had the money. As she is not rich, the chances that she will
        ever
        be able to afford such purchases are remote; but she is never sufficiently strongminded to be able to stop the
        practice. It is a harmless habit, but it litters up her desk to such an extent that every time she opens it;
        loose
        bits of paper fall out in every direction.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        居家度日，有目的地收藏某些东西是为了防止浪费。这些东西中我想举出线绳和包装纸为例。节俭的人们打开包裹后便把这两样必备的东西收藏起来，省得日后去买。收集小玩艺儿很容易着迷。我认识一个人，她总喜欢从报纸上剪下流行服装的图样，等以后有钱时去买服装。由于她并不富裕，她买得起这些服装的可能性十分渺茫。但她又缺乏足够坚强的意志把这一收集活动停下来。这种习惯无害，只是把写字台里堆得满满当当，以致每次打开抽屉总能带出许多纸片四处飞扬。
    </p>
    <p class="en">Collecting as a serious hobby is quite different and has many advantages. It provides relaxation for
        leisure hours, as just looking at one's treasures is always a joy. One does not have to go outside for
        amusement,
        since the collection is housed at home. Whatever it consists of, stamps, records, first editions of books,
        china,
        glass, antique furniture, pictures, model cars, stuffed birds, toy animals, there is always something to do in
        connection with it, from finding the right place for the latest addition, to verifying facts in reference books.
        This hobby educates one not only in the chosen subject, but also in general matters which have some bearing on
        it.
        There are also other benefits. One wants to meet like-minded collectors, to get advice, to compare notes, to
        exchange articles, to show off the latest find. So one's circle of friends grows. Soon the hobby leads to
        travel,
        perhaps to a meeting in another town, possibly a trip abroad in search of a rare specimen, for collectors are
        not
        confined to any one country. Over the years, one may well become an authority on one's hobby and will very
        probably
        be asked to give informal talks to little gatherings and then, if successful, to larger audiences. In this way
        self-confidence grows, first from mastering a subject, then from being able to talk about it. Collecting, by
        occupying spare time so constructively, makes a person contented, with no time for boredom.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        作为一种严肃的业余爱好的收藏活动完全是另外一回事，它具有许多益处。它可以使人在闲暇中得到休息，因为欣赏自己收藏的珍品总会充满了乐趣。人们不必走到户外去寻求娱乐，因为收藏品都是存放在家中。不管收藏品是什么，邮票、唱片、头版书籍、瓷器、玻璃杯、老式家具、绘画、模型汽车、鸟类标本，还是玩具动物，从为新增添的收藏品寻找摆放位置到核对参考书中的事实，总归有事可做。这种爱好不仅能使人从选择的专题中受到教育，而且也能从与之有关的一般事物中获得长进。除此之外，还有其他的益处。收藏者要会见情趣相投的收藏者，以获取教益、交流经验、交换收藏品、炫耀自己的最新收藏。朋友的圈子就这样不断扩太。用不了多久，有这种爱好的人便开始旅行，也许是去另一个城市参加会议，也可能是出国寻找一件珍品，因为收藏家是不分国籍的。一人积了多年经验会成为自己这种爱好的权威，很可能应邀在小型集会上作非正式的讲话。如果讲得好，可能向更多的人发表演说。这样，你自信心不断增强，先是因为掌握了一门学问，接下来是因为能够就此发表见解。收藏活动通过富有建设性地利用业余时间使人感到心满意足，不再有无聊之日。

    <p class="title">Lesson 60 Too early and too late 太早和太晚</p>
    <p class="en">Punctuality is a necessary habit in all public affairs in civilized society. Without it, nothing
        could
        ever be brought to a conclusion; everything would be in a state of chaos. Only in a sparsely-populated rural
        community is it possible to disregard it. In ordinary living, there can be some tolerance of unpunctuality. The
        intellectual, who is working on some abstruse problem, has everything coordinated and organized for the matter
        in
        hand. He is therefore forgiven, if late for a dinner party. But people are often reproached for unpunctuality
        when
        their only fault is cutting things fine. It is hard for energetic, quick-minded people to waste time, so they
        are
        often tempted to finish a job before setting out to keep an appointment. If no accidents occur on the way, like
        punctured tyres, diversions of traffic, sudden descent of fog, they will be on time. They are often more
        industrious, useful citizens than those who are never late. The over-punctual can be as much a trial to others
        as
        the unpunctual. The guest who arrives half an hour too soon is the greatest nuisance. Some friends of my family
        had
        this irritating habit. The only thing to do was ask them to come half an hour later than the other guests. Then
        they
        arrived just when we wanted them.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        准时是文明社会中进行一切社交活动时必须养成的习惯。不准时将一事无成，事事都会陷入混乱不堪的境地。只有在人口稀少的农村，才可以忽视准时的习惯。在日常生活中人们可以容忍一定程度的不准时。一个专心钻研某个复杂问题的知识分子，为了搞好手头的研究，要把一切都协调一致、组织周密。因此，他要是赴宴迟到了会得到谅解。但有些人不准时常常是因为掐钟点所致，他们常常会受到责备。精力充沛、头脑敏捷的人极不愿意浪费时间，因此他们常想做完一件事后再去赴约。要是路上没有发生如爆胎、改道、突然起雾等意外事故，他们是决不会迟到的。他们与那些从不迟到的人相比，常常是更勤奋有用的公民。早到的人同迟到的人一样令人讨厌。客人提前半小时到达是最令人讨厌的。我家有几个朋友就有这种令人恼火的习惯。唯一的办法就是请他们比别的客人晚来半小时。这样，他们可以恰好在我们要求的时间到达。
    </p>
    <p class="en">If you are catching a train, it is always better to be comfortably early than even a fraction of a
        minute
        too late. Although being early may mean wasting a little time, this will be less than if you miss the train and
        have
        to wait an hour or more for the next one; and you avoid the frustration of arriving at the very moment when the
        train is drawing out of the station and being unable to get on it. An even harder situation is to be on the
        platform
        in good time for a train and still to see it go off without you. Such an experience befell a certain young girl
        the
        first time she was travelling alone.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        如果赶火车，早到总比晚到好，哪怕早到一会儿也好。虽然早到可能意味着浪费一点时间，但这比误了火车、等上一个多小时坐下一班车浪费的时间要少，而且可以避免那种正好在火车驶出站时赶到车站，因上不去车而感到的沮丧。更难堪的情况是虽然及时赶到站台上，却眼睁睁地看着那趟火车启动，把你抛下。一个小姑娘第一次单独出门就碰到了这种情况。
    </p>
    <p class="en">She entered the station twenty minutes before the train was due, since her parents had impressed
        upon
        her
        that it would be unforgivable to miss it and cause the friends with whom she was going to stay to make two
        journeys
        to meet her. She gave her luggage to a porter and showed him her ticket. To her horror he said that she was two
        hours too soon. She felt in her handbag for the piece of paper on which her father had written down all the
        details
        of the journey and gave it to the porter. He agreed that a train did come into the station at the time on the
        paper
        and that it did stop, but only to take on mail, not passengers. The girl asked to see a timetable, feeling sure
        that
        her father could not have made such a mistake. The porter went to fetch one and arrived back with the station
        master, who produced it with a flourish and pointed out a microscopic ‘o’ beside the time of the arrival of the
        train at his station; this little ‘o’ indicated that the train only stopped for mail. Just as that moment the
        train
        came into the station. The girl, tears streaming down her face, begged to be allowed to slip into the guard's
        van.
        But the station master was adamant: rules could not be broken. And she had to watch that train disappear towards
        her
        destination while she was left behind.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        在火车进站20分钟前她就进了车站。因为她的父母再三跟她说，如果误了这趟车，她的东道主朋友就得接她两趟，这是不应该的。她把行李交给搬运工并给他看了车票。搬运工说她早到了两个小时，她听后大吃一惊。她从钱包里摸出一张纸条，那上面有她父亲对这次旅行的详细说明，她把这张纸条交给了搬运工。搬运工说，正如纸条上所说，确有一趟火车在那个时刻到站，但它只停站装邮件，不载旅客。姑娘要求看时刻表，因为她相信父亲不能把这么大的事给弄错。搬运工跑回去取时刻表，同时请来了站长。站长拿着时刻表一挥手，指着那趟列车到站时刻旁边的一个很小的圆圈标记。这个标记表示列车是为装邮件而停车。正在这时，火车进站了。女孩泪流满面，央求让她不声不响地到押车员车厢里去算了。但站长态度坚决，规章制度不能破环，姑娘只得眼看着那趟火车消逝在她要去的方向而撇下了她。

    <p class="title">Lesson 1 Finding fossil man 发现化石人</p>
    <p class="en">We can read of things that happened 5,000 years ago in the Near East, where people first learned to
        write. But there are some parts of the world where even now people cannot write. The only way that they can
        preserve
        their history is to recount it as sagas----legends handed down from one generation of story-tellers to another.
        These legends are useful because they can tell us something about migrations of people who lived long ago, but
        none
        could write down what they did. Anthropologists wondered where the remote ancestors of the Polynesian peoples
        now
        living in the Pacific Islands came from. The sagas of these people explain that some of them came from Indonesia
        about 2,000 years ago.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        我们从书籍中可以读到5,000年前近东发生的事情，那里的人最早学会了写字。但直到现在，世界上仍然有些地方；人们还不会书写。他们保存历史的唯一办法是将历史当作传说讲述，由讲述人一代接一代地将史实描述为传奇故事口传下来。这些传说是很有用的，因为它们能告诉我们以往人们迁居的情况。但是；没有人能把他们当时做的事情记载下来。人类学家过去不清楚如今生活在太平洋诸岛上的波利尼西亚人的祖先来自何方，当地人的传说却告诉了人们：其中有一部分是约在2,000年前从印度尼西亚迁来的。
    </p>
    <p class="en">But the first people who were like ourselves lived so long ago that even their sagas, if they had
        any,
        are forgotten. So archaeologists have neither history nor legends to help them to find out where the
        first‘modern
        men’ came from.</p>
    <p class="cn">但是，和我们相似的原始人生活的年代太久远了；因此，有关他们的传说即使有如今也失传了。于是，考古学家们既缺乏历史记载，又无口头传说来帮助他们弄清最早的“现代人”是从哪里来的。</p>
    <p class="en">Fortunately, however, ancient men made tools of stone, especially flint, because this is easier to
        shape
        than other kinds. They may also have used wood and skins, but these have rotted away. Stone does not decay, and
        so
        the tools of long ago have remained when even the bones of the men who made them have disappeared without trace.
    </p>
    <p class="cn">
        然而，幸运的是，远古人用石头制作了工具，特别是用燧石，因力燧石较之其他石头更易成形。他们也可能用过木头和兽皮，但这类东西早已腐烂殆尽。石头是不会腐烂的。因此，尽管制造这些工具的人的骨头早已荡然无存；但远古时代的石头工具却保存了下来。

    <p class="title">Lesson 2 Spare that spider不要伤害蜘蛛</p>
    <p class="en">Why, you may wonder, should spiders be our friends? Because they destroy so many insects, and
        insects
        include some of the greatest enemies of the human race．Insects would make it impossible for us to live in the
        world;
        they would devour all our crops and kill our flocks and herds, if it were not for the protection we get from
        insect-eating animals．We owe a lot to the birds and beasts who eat insects but all of them put together kill
        only a
        fraction of the number destroyed by spiders．Moreover, unlike some of the other insect eaters, spiders never do
        the
        least harm to us or our belongings.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        你可能会觉得奇怪，蜘蛛怎么会是我们的朋友呢？因为它们能消灭那么多的昆虫，其中包括一些人类的大敌。要不是人类受一些食虫动物的保护，昆虫就会使我们无法在地球上生活下去，昆虫会吞食我们的全部庄稼，杀死我们的成群的牛羊。我们要十分感谢那些吃昆虫的鸟和兽，然而把它们所杀死的昆虫全部加在一起也只相当于蜘蛛所消灭的一小部分。此外，蜘蛛不同于其他食虫动物，它们丝毫不危害我们和我们的财物。
    </p>
    <p class="en">Spiders are not insects, as many people think, nor even nearly related to them．One can tell the
        difference almost at a glance, for a spider always has eight legs and an insect never more than six.</p>
    <p class="cn">许多人认为蜘蛛是昆虫，但它们不是昆虫，甚至与昆虫毫无关系。人们几乎一眼就能看出二者的差异，因为蜘蛛都是8条腿，而昆虫的腿从不超过6条。</p>
    <p class="en">How many spiders are engaged in this work on our behalf? One authority on spiders made a census of
        the
        spiders in a grass field in the south of England, and he estimated that there were more than 2,250,000 in one
        acre;
        that is something like 6,000,000 spiders of different kinds on a football pitch．Spiders are busy for at least
        half
        the year in killing insects．It is impossible to make more than the wildest guess at how many they kill, but they
        are
        hungry creatures, not content with only three meals a day．It has been estimated that the weight of all the
        insects
        destroyed by spiders in Britain in one year would be greater than the total weight of all the human beings in
        the
        country.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        有多少蜘蛛在为我们效力呢？一位研究蜘蛛的权威对英国南部一块草坪上的蜘蛛作了一次调查。他估计每英亩草坪里有225万多只蜘蛛。这就是说，在一个足球场上约有600万只不同种类的蜘蛛。蜘蛛至少有半年忙于吃昆虫。它们一年中消灭了多少昆虫，我们简直无法猜测，它们是吃不饱的动物，不满意一日三餐。据估计，在英国蜘蛛一年里所消灭昆虫的重量超过了这个国家人口的总重量。

    <p class="en">Modern alpinists try to climb mountains by a route which will give them good sport, and the more
        difficult it is, the more highly it is regarded．In the pioneering days, however, this was not the case at
        all．The
        early climbers were looking for the easiest way to the top, because the summit was the prize they sought,
        especially
        if it had never been attained before．It is true that during their explorations they often faced difficulties and
        dangers of the most perilous nature, equipped in a manner which would make a modern climber shudder at the
        thought,
        but they did not go out of their way to court such excitement．They had a single aim, a solitary goal---the top!
    </p>
    <p class="cn">
        现代登山运动员总想找一条能够给他们带来运动乐趣的路线来攀登山峰。他们认为，道路愈艰险愈带劲儿。然而，在登山运动的初期，全然不是这种情况。早期登山者所寻找的是通往山顶的最方便的途径，因为顶峰——特别是前人未曾到过的顶峰——才是他们寻求的目标。确实，在探险中他们经常遇到惊心动魄的困难和危险，而他们装备之简陋足以使现代登山者一想起来就胆战心惊。但是，他们并非故意寻求这种刺激，他们只有一个目的，唯一的目标——顶峰！
    </p>
    <p class="en">It is hard for us to realize nowadays how difficult it was for the pioneers．Except for one or two
        places
        such as Zermatt and Chamonix, which had rapidly become popular, Alpine villages tended to be impoverished
        settlements cut off from civilization by the high mountains．Such inns as there were generally dirty and
        flea-ridden;
        the food simply local cheese accompanied by bread often twelve months old, all washed down with coarse
        wine．Often a
        valley boasted no inn at all, and climbers found shelter wherever they could---sometimes with the local priest
        (who
        was usually as poor as his parishioners), sometimes with shepherds or cheese-makers．Invariably the background
        was
        the same: dirt and poverty, and very uncomfortable．For men accustomed to eating seven-course dinners and
        sleeping
        between fine linen sheets at home, the change to the Alps must have been very hard indeed．</p>
    <p class="cn">
        我们今天很难想象昔日的登山先驱们是多么艰苦。除了泽曼特和夏蒙尼等一两个很快出了名的地方外，阿尔卑斯山山区的小村几乎全是高山环抱、与世隔绝的穷乡僻壤。那里的小客栈一般都很肮脏，而且跳蚤猖獗。食物是当地的干酪和通常存放了一年之久的面包，人们就着劣质酒吞下这种食物。山谷里常常没有小客栈，登山者只好随遇而安。有时同当地牧师（他通常和他的教民一样穷）住在一起，有时同牧羊人或制乳酪的人住在一起。无论住在哪儿，情况都一样：肮脏、贫穷，极其不舒适。对于过惯了一顿饭吃7道菜、睡亚麻细布床单的人来说，变换一下生活环境来到阿尔卑斯山山区，那一定是很艰难的。

    <p class="title">Lesson 6 The sporting spirit体育的精神</p>
    <p class="en">I am always amazed when I hear people saying that sport creates goodwill between the nations, and
        that if
        only the common peoples of the world could meet one another at football or cricket, they would have no
        inclination
        to meet on the battlefield．Even if one didn't know from concrete examples (the 1936 Olympic Games, for instance)
        that international sporting contests lead to orgies of hatred, one could deduce it from general principles.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        当我听人们说体育运动可创造国家之间的友谊，还说各国民众若在足球场或板球场上交锋，就不愿在战场上残杀的时候，我总是惊愕不已。一个人即使不能从具体的事例（如1936年奥林匹克运动会）了解到国际运动比赛会导致疯狂的仇恨，也可以从常理中推断出结论。
    </p>
    <p class="en">Nearly all the sports practiced nowadays are competitive．You play to win, and the game has little
        meaning
        unless you do your utmost to win．On the village green, where you pick up sides and no feeling of local
        patriotism is
        involved, it is possible to play simply for the fun and exercise: but as soon as the question of prestige
        arises, as
        soon as you feel that you and some larger unit will be disgraced if you lose, the most savage combative
        instincts
        are aroused．Anyone who has played even in a school football match knows this．At the international level, sport
        is
        frankly mimic warfare．But the significant thing is not the behavior of the players but the attitude of the
        spectators: and, behind the spectators, of the nations who work themselves into furies over these absurd
        contests,
        and seriously believe --- at any rate for short periods --- that running, jumping and kicking a ball are tests
        of
        national virtue.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        现在开展的体育运动几乎都是竞争性的。参加比赛就是为了取胜。如果不拼命去赢，比赛就没有什么意义了。在乡间的草坪上，当你随意组成两个队，并且不涉及任何地方情绪时，那才有可能是单纯为了娱乐和锻炼而进行比赛。可是一旦涉及到荣誉问题，一旦你想到你和某一团体会因你输了而丢脸时，那么最野蛮的争斗天性便会被激发起来。即使是仅仅参加过学校足球赛的人也有这种体会。在国际比赛中，体育简直是一场模拟战争。但是，要紧的还不是运动员的行为，而是观众的态度，以及观众身后各个国家的态度。面对着这些荒唐的比赛，参赛的各个国家会如痴如狂，甚至煞有介事地相信——至少在短期内如此——跑跑、跳跳、踢踢球是对一个民族品德素质的检验。

    <p class="title">Lesson 15 Secrecy in industry 工业中的秘密</p>
    <p class="en">Two factors weigh heavily against the effectiveness of scientific research in industry. One is the
        general atmosphere of secrecy in which it is carried out, the other the lack of freedom of the individual
        research
        worker. In so far as any inquiry is a secret one, it naturally limits all those engaged in carrying it out from
        effective contact with their fellow scientists either in other countries or in universities, or even, often
        enough,
        in other departments of the same firm. The degree of secrecy naturally varies considerably. Some of the bigger
        firms
        are engaged in researches which are of such general and fundamental nature that it is a positive advantage to
        them
        not to keep them secret. Yet a great many processes depending on such research are sought for with complete
        secrecy
        until the stage at which patents can be taken out. Even more processes are never patented at all but kept as
        secret
        processes. This applies particularly to chemical industries, where chance discoveries play a much larger part
        than
        they do in physical and mechanical industries. Sometimes the secrecy goes to such an extent that the whole
        nature of
        the research cannot be mentioned. Many firms, for instance, have great difficulty in obtaining technical or
        scientific books from libraries because they are unwilling to have their names entered as having taken out such
        and
        such a book for fear the agents of other firms should be able to trace the kind of research they are likely to
        be
        undertaking.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        有两个因素严重地妨碍着工业中科学研究的效率：一是科研工作中普遍存在的保密气氛；二是研究人员缺乏个人自由。任何一项研究都涉及到保密，那些从事科研的人员自然受到了限制。他们不能和其他国家、其他大学、甚至往往不能与本公司的其他部门的同行们进行有效的接触。保密程度自然差别很大。某些大公司进行的研究属于一般和基础性的研究。因此不保密对他们才有利。然而，依赖这种研究的很多工艺程序是在完全保密的情况下进行的，直到可以取得专利权的阶段为止。更多的工艺过程根本就不会取得专利权，而是作为秘方保存着。这在化学工业方面尤其突出。同物理和机械工业相比，化学工业中偶然发现的机会要多得多。有时，保密竟达到了这样的程度，即连研究工作的整个性质都不准提及。比如，很多公司向图书馆借阅科技书籍时感到很困难，因为它们不愿让人家记下它们公司的名字和借阅的某一本书。他们生怕别的公司的情报人员据此摸到他们可能要从事的某项科研项目。

    <p class="title">Lesson 16 The modern city 现代城市</p>
    <p class="en">In the organization of industrial life the influence of the factory upon the physiological and
        mental
        state of the workers has been completely neglected．Modern industry is based on the conception of the maximum
        production at lowest cost, in order that an individual or a group of individuals may earn as much money as
        possible．It has expanded without any idea of the true nature of the human beings who run the machines, and
        without
        giving any consideration to the effects produced on the individuals and on their descendants by the artificial
        mode
        of existence imposed by the factory．The great cities have been built with no regard for us．</p>
    <p class="cn">
        在工业生活的组织中，工厂对工人的生理和精神状态的影响完全被忽视了。现代工业的基本概念是：以最低成本获取最多产品，为的是让某个个人或某一部分人尽可能多地赚钱。现代工业发展起来了，却根本没想到操作机器的人的本质。工厂把一种人为的生存方式强加给工人，却不顾及这种生存方式给工人及其后代带来的影响。大城市的建设毫不关心我们。
    </p>
    <p class="en">The shape and dimensions of the skyscrapers depend entirely on the necessity of obtaining the
        maximum
        income per square foot of ground, and of offering to the tenants offices and apartments that please them．This
        caused
        the construction of gigantic buildings where too large masses of human beings are crowded together．Civilized men
        like such a way of living．While they enjoy the comfort and banal luxury of their dwelling, they do not realize
        that
        they are deprived of the necessities of life．The modern city consists of monstrous edifices and of dark, narrow
        streets full of petrol fumes and toxic gases, torn by the noise of the taxi-cabs, lorries and buses, and
        thronged
        ceaselessly by great crowds．Obviously, it has not been planned for the good of its inhabitants. </p>
    <p class="cn">
        摩天大楼完全是按这样的需要修建的：每平方英尺地皮取得最大收入和向租房人提供使他满意的办公室和住房。这样就导致了许多摩天大厦拔地而起，大厦内众多的人挤在一起。文明人喜欢这样一种生活方式。在享受自己住宅的舒适和庸俗的豪华时，却没有意识到被剥夺了生活所必需的东西。大得吓人的高楼和阴暗狭窄的街道组成了今日现代化的城市。街道上充斥着汽油味和有毒气体，出租汽车、卡车、公共汽车的噪音刺耳难忍，络绎不绝的人群挤来挤去。显然，现代化的城市不是为居民的利益而规划的。

    <p class="title">Lesson 22 Knowledge and progress 知识和进步</p>
    <p class="en">Why does the idea of progress loom so large in the modern world? Surely because progress of a
        particular
        kind is actually taking place around us and is becoming more and more manifest．Although mankind has undergone no
        general improvement in intelligence or morality, it has made extraordinary progress in the accumulation of
        knowledge．</p>
    <p class="cn">
        为什么进步这个概念在现代世界显得如此突出？无疑是因为有一种特殊的进步实际上正在我们周围发生，而且变得越来越明显。虽然人类在智力和道德上没有得到普遍提高，但在知识积累方面却取得了巨大的进步。
    </p>
    <p class="en">Knowledge began to increase as soon as the thoughts of one individual could be communicated to
        another
        by
        means of speech．With the invention of writing, a great advance was made,for knowledge could then be not only
        communicated but also stored．Libraries made education possible, and education in its turn added to libraries:
        the
        growth of knowledge followed a kind of compound-interest law,which was greatly enhanced by the invention of
        printing．All this was comparatively slow until, with the coming of science, the tempo was suddenly raised．Then
        knowledge began to be accumulated according to a systematic plan．The trickle became a stream; the stream has now
        become a torrent．</p>
    <p class="cn">
        人一旦能用语言同别人交流思想，知识的积累便开始了。随着书写的发明，又迈进了一大步，因为这样一来，知识不仅能交流，而且能储存了。藏书使教育成为可能，而教育反过来又丰富了藏书，因为知识的增长遵循着一种“滚雪球”的规律。印刷术的发明又大大提高了知识增长的速度。所有这些发展都比较缓慢，而随着科学的到来，增长的速度才突然加快。于是，知识便开始有系统有计划地积累起来。涓涓细流汇成了小溪，小溪现已变成了奔腾的江河。
    </p>
    <p class="en">Moreover, as soon as new knowledge is acquired, it is now turned to practical account．What is
        called‘modern civilization’is not the result of a balanced development of all man's nature, but of accumulated
        knowledge applied to practical life．The problem now facing humanity is: What is going to be done with all this
        knowledge? As is so often pointed out, knowledge is a two-edged weapon which can be used equally for good or
        evil．It
        is now being used indifferently for both．Could any spectacle, for instance, be more grimly whimsical than that
        of
        gunners using science to shatter men's bodies while, close at hand, surgeons use it to restore them? We have to
        ask
        ourselves very seriously what will happen if this twofold use of knowledge, with its ever-increasing
        power,continues.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        而且，新知识一旦获得，便得到实际应用。所谓“现代文明”并不是人的天性平衡发展的结果，而是积累起来的知识应用到实际生活中的结果。现在人类面临的问题是：用这些知识去做什么？正像人们常常指出的，知识是一把双刃刀，可以用于造福，也可用来为害。人们现在正漫不经心地把知识用于这两个方面，例如：炮兵利用科学毁坏人的身体、而外科医生就在附近用科学抢救被炮兵毁坏的人体，还有什么情景比这更可怕、更怪诞的吗？我们不得不严肃地问问我们自己：随着日益增长的知识的力量，如果我们继续利用知识的这种双重性，将会发生什么样的情况呢？

    <p class="title">Lesson 32 Galileo reborn 伽利略的复生</p>
    <p class="en">In his own lifetime Galileo was the centre of violent controversy; but the scientific dust has long
        since
        settled, and today we can see even his famous clash with the Inquisition in something like its proper
        perspective.
        But, in contrast, it is only in modern times that Galileo has become a problem child for historians of science.
    </p>
    <p class="cn">
        伽利略在世时是激烈论战的中心。但是，自他逝世以来，那场科学上的纷争早已平息了下来，甚至他和宗教法庭的著名冲突，我们今天也能正确如实地看待。但是相比之下，对于科学史家来说，伽利略只是在现代才变成一个新的难题。
    </p>
    <p class="en">The old view of Galileo was delightfully uncomplicated. He was, above all, a man who experimented:
        who
        despised the prejudices and book learning of the Aristotelians, who put his questions to nature instead of to
        the
        ancients, and who drew his conclusions fearlessly. He had been the first to turn a telescope to the sky, and he
        had
        seen there evidence enough to overthrow Aristotle and Ptolemy together. He was the man who climbed the Leaning
        Tower
        of Pisa and dropped various weights from the top, who rolled balls down inclined planes, and then generalized
        the
        results of his many experiments into the famous law of free fall.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        令人高兴的是，过去对伽利略的看法并不复杂。他首先是个实验工作者，他蔑视亚里士多德学派的偏见和空洞的书本知识。他向自然界而不是向古人提出问题，并大胆地得出自己的结论。他是第一个把望远镜对准天空的人，观察到的论据足以把亚里士多德和托勒密一起推翻。他就是那个曾经爬上比萨斜塔，从塔顶向下抛掷各种重物的人；他就是那个使球体沿斜面向下滚动，然后将多次实验结果概括成著名的自由落体定律的人。
    </p>
    <p class="en">But a closer study of the evidence, supported by a deeper sense of the period, and particularly by a
        new
        consciousness of the philosophical undercurrents in the scientific revolution, has profoundly modified this view
        of
        Galileo. Today, although the old Galileo lives on in many popular writings, among historians of science a new
        and
        more sophisticated picture has emerged. At the same time our sympathy for Galileo's opponents has grown
        somewhat.
        His telescopic observations are justly immortal; they aroused great interest at the time, they had important
        theoretical consequences, and they provided a striking demonstration of the potentialities hidden in instruments
        and
        apparatus. But can we blame those who looked and failed to see what Galileo saw, if we remember that to use a
        telescope at the limit of its powers calls for long experience and intimate familiarity with one's instrument?
        Was
        the philosopher who refused to look through Galileo's telescope more culpable than those who alleged that the
        spiral
        nebulae observed with Lord Rosse's great telescope in the eighteen-forties were scratches left by the grinder?
        We
        can perhaps forgive those who said the moons of Jupiter were produced by Galileo's spyglass if we recall that in
        his
        day, as for centuries before, curved glass was the popular contrivance for producing not truth but illusion,
        untruth; and if a single curved glass would distort nature, how much more would a pair of them?</p>
    <p class="cn">
        但是，对那个时代的深化了解，尤其是以科学革命中哲学潜流的新意识为依据，进一步仔细研究，就会极大地改变对伽利略的看法。今天，虽然已故的伽利略继续活在许多通俗读物中，但在科学史家中间，一个新的更加复杂的伽利略的形象出现了。与此同时，我们对伽利略的反对派的同情也有所增加。伽利略用望远镜所作的观察确实是不朽的，这些观察在当时引起了人们极大的兴趣，具有重要的理论意义，并充分显示出了仪表和仪器的潜在力量。但是，如果我们想到，使用一架倍数有限的望远镜需要长期的经验和对自己仪器的熟悉程度，那么我们怎么能去责备观察了天空但没有看到伽利略所看到的东西的那些人呢？某位哲学家曾拒绝使用伽利略的望远镜去观察天空；到了19世纪40年代，有人硬把罗斯勋爵高倍望远镜观测到的螺旋状星云说成是磨镜工留下的磨痕。难道反对伽利略的哲学家比诋毁罗斯勋爵造谣者应受到更大的谴责吗？如果我们回想一下伽利略之前的几个世纪期间，曲面镜一直是一种用于产生幻影而不是产生真象的把戏装置，那么我们就会原谅那些当初把伽利略观察到的木星卫星说成是伽利略用他的小望远镜变出来的人们，何况一片曲面镜就可歪曲自然，那么伽利略的两片曲面镜对自然的歪曲又该多大呢？

    <p class="title">Lesson 33 Education 教育</p>
    <p class="en">Education is one of the key words of our time. A man without an education, many of us believe, is an
        unfortunate victim of adverse circumstances, deprived of one of the greatest twentieth-century opportunities.
        Convinced of the importance of education, modern states ‘invest’ in institutions of learning to get back
        ‘interest’
        in the form of a large group of enlightened young men and women who are potential leaders. Education, with its
        cycles of instruction so carefully worked out, punctuated by text-books----those purchasable wells of
        wisdom----what
        would civilization be like without its benefits?</p>
    <p class="cn">
        教育是我们这个时代的关键词之一。我们许多人都相信，一个没有受过教育的人，是逆境的牺牲品，被剥夺了20世纪最优越的机会之一。现代国家深深懂得教育的重要性，对教育机构投资，收回的“利息”便是培养出大批有知识的男女青年，这些人可能会成为未来的栋梁。教育，以其教学周期如此精心地安排，并以教科书—那些可以买到的智慧源泉—予以强化，如果不受其惠，文明将会是个什么样子呢？
    </p>
    <p class="en">So much is certain: that we would have doctors and preachers, lawyers and defendants, marriages and
        births---but our spiritual outlook would be different. We would lay less stress on ‘facts and figures’ and more
        on a
        good memory, on applied psychology, and on the capacity of a man to get along with his fellow-citizens. If our
        educational system were fashioned after its bookless past we would have the most democratic form of ‘college’
        imaginable. Among tribal people all knowledge inherited by tradition is shared by all; it is taught to every
        member
        of the tribe so that in this respect everybody is equally equipped for life.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        至少，这些是可以肯定的：虽然我们还会有医生和牧师、律师和被告、婚姻和生育，但人们的精神面貌将是另一个样子。人们不会再重视“资料和数据”，而靠好记性、实用心理学和与同伴相处的能力。如果我们的教育制度仿效没有书籍的古代教育，我们的学院将具有可以想象得出的最民主的形式了。在部落中，通过传统继承的知识为所有人共享，并传授给部落中的每一个成员。从这个意义上讲，人人受到的有关生活本领的教育是相等的。
    </p>
    <p class="en">It is the ideal condition of the ‘equal start’ which only our most progressive forms of modern
        education
        try to regain. In primitive cultures the obligation to seek and to receive the traditional instruction is
        binding to
        all. There are no ‘illiterates’----if the term can be applied to peoples without a script----while our own
        compulsory school attendance became law in Germany in 1642, in France in 1806, and in England in 1876, and is
        still
        non-existent in a number of ‘civilized’ nations. This shows how long it was before we deemed it necessary to
        make
        sure that all our children could share in the knowledge accumulated by the ‘happy few’ during the past
        centuries.
    </p>
    <p class="cn">
        这就是我们最进步的现代教育试图恢复的“平等起步”的理想状况。在原始文化中，寻求和接受传统教育的义务对全民都有约束力，因而没有“文盲”（如果这个字眼儿可以用于没有文字的民族的话）。而我们的义务教育成为法律在德国是在1642年，在法国是在1806年，在英国是在1876年。今天，在许多“文明”国家里，义务教育迄今尚未实行。这说明，经过了多么漫长的时间之后，我们才认识到，有必要确保我们的孩子享有多少个世纪以来由“少数幸运者”所积累起来的知识。
    </p>
    <p class="en">Education in the wilderness is not a matter of monetary means. All are entitled to an equal start.
        There
        is none of the hurry which, in our society, often hampers the full development of a growing personality. There,
        a
        child grows up under the ever-present attention of his parents; therefore the jungles and the savannahs know of
        no
        ‘juvenile delinquency’. No necessity of making a living away from home results in neglect of children, and no
        father
        is confronted with his inability to ‘buy’ an education for his child.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        荒凉地区的教育不是钱的问题，所有的人都享有平等起步的权利。那里没有我们今天社会中的匆忙生活，而匆忙的生活常常妨碍个性的全面发展。荒凉地区的孩子无时无刻不在父母关怀下成长。因此，丛林和荒凉地区不知道什么叫“青少年犯罪”。人们没有必要离家谋生，所以不会产生孩子无人管的问题，也不存在父亲无力为孩子支付教育费用而犯难的问题。

    <p class="title">Lesson 34 Adolescence 青春期</p>
    <p class="en">Parents are often upset when their children praise the homes of their friends and regard it as a
        slur
        on
        their own cooking, or cleaning, or furniture, and often are foolish enough to let the adolescents see that they
        are
        annoyed. They may even accuse them of disloyalty, or make some spiteful remark about the friends' parents. Such
        a
        loss of dignity and descent into childish behavior on the part of the adults deeply shocks the adolescents, and
        makes them resolve that in future they will not talk to their parents about the places or people they visit.
        Before
        very long the parents will be complaining that the child is so secretive and never tells them anything, but they
        seldom realize that they have brought this on themselves.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        当家长听到孩子赞扬自己朋友的家时，总感到不安，认为这是孩子在嫌弃自家的饭菜、卫生、或家具，而且愚蠢地让孩子看出自己的烦恼。他们甚至责备孩子不忠，或者讲些小朋友家长的坏话。家长这种有失身份和孩子气的作法使青春期的孩子大为震惊，决心以后不再向父母讲述去过的地方和见过的人。不要很久，家长就会抱怨孩子守口如瓶，什么事也不告诉他们，殊不知这是他们自找的。
    </p>
    <p class="en">Disillusionment with the parents, however good and adequate they may be both as parents and as
        individuals, is to some degree inevitable. Most children have such a high ideal of their parents, unless the
        parents
        themselves have been unsatisfactory, that it can hardly hope to stand up to a realistic evaluation. Parents
        would be
        greatly surprised and deeply touched if they realized how much belief their children usually have in their
        character
        and infallibility, and how much this faith means to a child. If parents were prepared for this adolescent
        reaction,
        and realized that it was a sign that the child was growing up and developing valuable powers of observation and
        independent judgment, they would not be so hurt, and therefore would not drive the child into opposition by
        resenting and resisting it.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        不管家长的人品有多么好，作为父母又多么合格，孩子们对家长幻想的破灭在某种程度上是不可避免的。除非父母自身不能令人满意，大多数孩子对父母估价过高，以致这种估价很难指望经受住现实的考验。如果家长意识到孩子们通常是多么相信家长的品行和绝对正确，意识到孩子们的这种信念会对孩子产生多么大的影响，那么家长会大为吃惊和深受感动的。如果家长对青少年的这种反应有思想准备，并且意识到这象征着孩子们正在成熟和正在发展宝贵的观察力、独立判断力，那么他们就不会那样伤心，也就不会由于怨恨和抵触这种反应，而把孩子推到自己的对立面去。
    </p>
    <p class="en">The adolescent, with his passion for sincerity, always respects a parent who admits that he is
        wrong,
        or
        ignorant, or even that he has been unfair or unjust. What the child cannot forgive is the parents' refusal to
        admit
        these charges if the child knows them to be true.</p>
    <p class="cn">青少年酷爱真诚，对于能够承认错误或无知、甚至承认自己做得不公平或不公正的父母，他们总是尊敬的。孩子们所不能原谅的是：父母错了，孩子们也看出来了，可是做父母的还不肯承认。</p>
    <p class="en">Victorian parents believed that they kept their dignity by retreating behind an unreasoning
        authoritarian
        attitude; in fact they did nothing of the kind, but children were then too cowed to let them know how they
        really
        felt. Today we tend to go to the other extreme, but on the whole this is a healthier attitude both for the child
        and
        the parent. It is always wiser and safer to face up to reality, however painful it may be at the moment.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        维多利亚时代的父母认为，他们可以靠无理的权威气派来维护自己的尊严，实际上那是根本不行的。孩子们只不过被吓得不敢让父母知道自己的想法罢了。虽然现在我们倾向于走向另一个极端，但总地来看，孩子和家长双方态度都比较端正。遇事采取面对现实的态度总是比较明智和稳妥的，尽管会有暂时的痛苦。

    <p class="title">Lesson 36 The cost of government 政府的开支</p>
    <p class="en">If a nation is essentially disunited, it is left to the government to hold it together. This
        increases
        the expense of government, and reduces correspondingly the amount of economic resources that could be used for
        developing the country. And it should not be forgotten how small those resources are in a poor and backward
        country.
        Where the cost of government is high, resources for development are correspondingly low.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        如果一个国家实际上处于分裂状态，使之联合起来就是政府的事了。这样一来就增加了政府的开支，从而相应地减少了可以用来发展国家的那部分经济资源。不应忘记，在一个贫穷落后的国家里，那部分财力是很有限的。凡是政府管理费用高的地方，用于发展国家经济的资金就会相应地减少。
    </p>
    <p class="en">This may be illustrated by comparing the position of a nation with that of a private business
        enterprise.
        An enterprise has to incur certain costs and expenses in order to stay in business. For our purposes, we are
        concerned only with one kind of cost---the cost of managing and administering the business. Such administrative
        overheads in a business are analogous to the cost of government in a nation. The administrative overheads of a
        business are low to the extent that everyone working in the business can be trusted to behave in a way that best
        promotes the interests of the firm. If they can each be trusted to take such responsibilities, and to exercise
        such
        initiative as falls within their sphere, then administrative overhead will be low. It will be low because it
        will be
        necessary to have only one man looking after each job, without having another man to check upon what he is
        doing,
        keep him in line, and report on him to someone else. But if no one can be trusted to act in a loyal and
        responsible
        manner towards his job, then the business will require armies of administrators, checkers, and foremen, and
        administrative overheads will rise correspondingly. As administrative overhead rises, so the earnings of the
        business, after meeting the expense of administration, will fall; and the business will have less money to
        distribute as dividends or invest directly in its future progress and development.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        把国家的状况同私人企业的状况加以比较，就可以看清这个问题。一个企业为了继续经营，不得不支出一定的费用和开销。就我们的目的而言，我们只关心一种费用—企业行政管理费。一家企业的这种行政管理开支类似于一个国家的政府管理所用的开支。如果企业中的每个人都在真诚地为提高企业利润而工作，那么企业的管理费用就会降低到相应的程度。如果企业的每个人都信得过，人人都认真负责，在各自的工作范围内发挥主动性，行政管理费用就会降低。行政管理费用降低的原因是：每项工作只需一个人去完成，用不着另外再有一个人检查他的工作，督促他遵守章程，或向有关人士汇报他的工作。但是，如果企业中谁也不可信赖会对工作尽忠守职，那么企业就会需要大批的管理人员、检查人员和带班人员，管理费用就会相应地增加。管理费用增加了，那么在扣除管理费用后，企业的收入就降低了。因而用于分红的金额或直接用于将来开拓和发展的投资就相应地减少了。
    </p>
    <p class="en">It is precisely the same with a nation. To the extent that the people can be relied upon to behave
        in
        a
        loyal and responsible manner, the government does not require armies of police and civil servants to keep them
        in
        order. But if a nation is disunited, the government cannot be sure that the actions of the people will be in the
        interests of the nation; and it will have to watch, check, and control the people accordingly. A disunited
        nation
        therefore has to incur unduly high costs of government.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        一个国家的情况也完全相同。如果人民忠于职守，举止规矩，能受到政府的信赖，那么政府就不需要大批的警察和文职人员去促使人民遵纪守法。但是，如果一个国家处于分裂状态，政府不能相信人民的行动有利于国家，那么政府就不得不对人民进行监督、检查和控制。因此，一个处于分裂状态的国家必然要支付过高的行政管理费用。

    <p class="title">Lesson 37 The process of ageing 衰老过程</p>
    <p class="en">At the age of twelve years, the human body is at its most vigorous. It has yet to reach its full
        size
        and
        strength, and its owner his or her full intelligence; but at this age the likelihood of death is least. Earlier,
        we
        were infants and young children, and consequently more vulnerable; later, we shall undergo a progressive loss of
        our
        vigour and resistance which, though imperceptible at first, will finally become so steep that we can live no
        longer,
        however well we look after ourselves, and however well society, and our doctors, look after us. This decline in
        vigour with the passing of time is called ageing. It is one of the most unpleasant discoveries which we all make
        that we must decline in this way, that if we escape wars, accidents and diseases we shall eventually ‘die of old
        age’, and that this happens at a rate which differs little from person to person, so that there are heavy odds
        in
        favour of our dying between the ages of sixty-five and eighty. Some of us will die sooner, a few will live
        longer----on into a ninth or tenth decade. But the chances are against it, and there is a virtual limit on how
        long
        we can hope to remain alive, however lucky and robust we are.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        人体在12岁时是生命力最旺盛的时期。虽然在这个时期人的身材、体力和智力还有待发展和完善，但在这个年龄死亡的可能性最小。再早一些，我们是幼儿和小孩子，身体较脆弱；再迟一些，我们就要经历生命力和抵抗力逐步衰退的过程。虽然这个过程起初难以觉察，但最终会急转直下，不管我们怎样精心照料我们自己，不管社会和医生怎样对我们进行精心照顾，我们也无法再活下去了。生命力随时间的流失而衰退叫做衰老。人类发现的最不愉快的一个事实是：人必然会衰老。既使我们能避开战争、意外的事故和各种疾病，我们最终也会“老死”；衰老的速度在人与人之间相差甚微，我们最可能死亡的年龄在65至80岁之间，有些人会死得早一些，少数人寿命会长一些——活到八十几岁或九十几岁，但这种可能性很小。不管我们多么幸运，多么健壮，我们所希望的长寿实际上是有限度的。
    </p>
    <p class="en">Normal people tend to forget this process unless and until they are reminded of it. We are so
        familiar
        with the fact that man ages, that people have for years assumed that the process of losing vigour with time, of
        becoming more likely to die the older we get, was something self-evident, like the cooling of a hot kettle or
        the
        wearing-out of a pair of shoes. They have also assumed that all animals, and probably other organisms such as
        trees,
        or even the universe itself, must in the nature of things ‘wear out’. Most animals we commonly observe do in
        fact
        age as we do, if given the chance to live long enough; and mechanical systems like a wound watch, or the sun, do
        in
        fact run out of energy in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics (whether the whole universe does so
        is a
        moot point at present). But these are not analogous to what happens when man ages. A run-down watch is still a
        watch
        and can be rewound. An old watch, by contrast, becomes so worn and unreliable that it eventually is not worth
        mending. But a watch could never repair itself----it does not consist of living parts, only of metal, which
        wears
        away by friction. We could, at one time, repair ourselves----well enough, at least, to overcome all but the most
        instantly fatal illnesses and accidents. Between twelve and eighty years we gradually lose this power; an
        illness
        which at twelve would knock us over, at eighty can knock us out, and into our grave. If we could stay as
        vigorous as
        we are at twelve, it would take about 700 years for half of us to die, and another 700 for the survivors to be
        reduced by half again.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        衰老的过程，不经提起，正常人容易忘记；一经提醒，才会记起。我们对人总是要衰老的现象并不陌生，多年来就已认识到。生命力随着时间流失而丧失活力，人随着年龄的增长而接近死亡，这是不言而喻的，就像一壶热水迟早会凉下来，一双鞋渐渐会磨破一样。人们不但认识到所有的动物，大概也认识到所有的有机物，如树木，甚至宇宙本身，从事物的本质上来说都会“磨损掉”。我们通常看到的大多数动物，即使能让它们活得足够长久的话，也会像我们一样衰老的。像上紧发条的手表那样的机械装置，或太阳，也都会消耗完其能量（整个宇宙是否如此，目前尚有争论）。不过，这些衰老的情况同人并不相似。手表停了依然是只手表，还可以重上好发条。然而一只老掉牙的手表，磨损太厉害，老得一点儿也不准了，最终会不值得修理了。但是，手表决不会自行修理，它不是由有生命的部件组成，而是由金属组成，而金属可以随着磨擦而磨损殆尽。而我们人，在一定时间内是可以自行修复的，除了暴病而死或意外事故外，至少足以克服一切一般疾病和事故。在12岁至80岁之间，我们逐渐丧失这种能力。能使我们在12岁时病倒的疾病，到了80岁可能会使我们一蹶不振而进入坟墓。假如我们能保持12岁时的旺盛生命力，那么我们当中的一半人过700年才死去，剩下的一半人再过700年，才会又减少一半。

    <p class="title">Lesson 39 What every writer wants 作家之所需</p>
    <p class="en">I have known very few writers, but those I have known, and whom I respect, confess at once that they
        have
        little idea where they are going when they first set pen to paper. They have a character, perhaps two; they are
        in
        that condition of eager discomfort which passes for inspiration; all admit radical changes of destination once
        the
        journey has begun; one, to my certain knowledge, spent nine months on a novel about Kashmir, then reset the
        whole
        thing in the Scottish Highlands. I never heard of anyone making a ‘skeleton’, as we were taught at school. In
        the
        breaking and remaking, in the timing, interweaving, beginning afresh, the writer comes to discern things in his
        material which were not consciously in his mind when he began. This organic process, often leading to moments of
        extraordinary self-discovery, is of an indescribable fascination. A blurred image appears; he adds a brushstroke
        and
        another, and it is gone; but something was there, and he will not rest till he has captured it. Sometimes the
        yeast
        within a writer outlives a book he has written. I have heard of writers who read nothing but their own books;
        like
        adolescents they stand before the mirror, and still cannot fathom the exact outline of the vision before them.
        For
        the same reason, writers talk interminably about their own books, winkling out hidden meanings, super-imposing
        new
        ones, begging response from those around them. Of course a writer doing this is misunderstood: he might as well
        try
        to explain a crime or a love affair. He is also, incidentally, an unforgivable bore.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        我所认识的作家寥寥无几，然而凡是我所认识和尊敬的作家，都立即承认在他们动笔时，不清楚要写什么，怎么写。他们心中有一个或两个角色。他们处于急切不安的状态，而这被当作是灵感。他们无不承认，一旦“旅程”开始，“目的地”常有急剧的变化。据我所知，有位作家花了9个月的时间写了一部有关克什米尔的小说，后来却把整个故事背景换成了苏格兰高地。我从未听说过任何一位作家像我们在学校学的那样，动笔前先列什么提纲。作家在剪裁修改、构思时间、穿插情节、以至从头重写的过程中，会领悟到素材中有很多东西是他刚动笔时所未意识到的。这种有机的加工过程往往达到不寻常自我发现的境界，具有难以言表的构思魅力。一个朦胧的形象出现在作家的脑海里，他左添一笔，右添一笔，形象反而消逝了；可是，好像还有什么东西存在着，不把它捕捉到，作家是不会罢休的。有时，一个作家一本书写完了，但兴奋仍不消散。我听说一些作家，除了自己的书外，别的书一概不读，犹如希腊神话中那位漂亮少年，站在镜前，不能辨认出自身的真面目。由于这个原因，作家喋喋不休地谈论自己的书，挖掘其隐晦的含义，增添新的含义，询问周围人的反应。作家如此行事当然会被人误解。他还不如给人讲一个犯罪案件或一个恋爱故事。顺便说一句，他也是个不可饶恕的令人厌烦的人。
    </p>
    <p class="en">This temptation to cover the distance between himself and the reader, to study his image in the
        sight
        of
        those who do not know him, can be his undoing: he has begun to write to please.</p>
    <p class="cn">这种企图消除自己和读者之间距离的作法，企图用不了解自己的人的观点来研究自己塑造的形象的作法，会导致作家的毁灭，因为他已经开始为取悦他人而写作了。</p>
    <p class="en">A young English writer made the pertinent observation a year or two back that the talent goes into
        the
        first draft, and the art into the drafts that follow. For this reason also the writer, like any other artist,
        has no
        resting place, no crowd or movement in which he may take comfort, no judgment from outside which can replace the
        judgment from within. A writer makes order out of the anarchy of his heart; he submits himself to a more
        ruthless
        discipline than any critic dreamed of, and when he flirts with fame, he is taking time off from living with
        himself,
        from the search for what his world contains at its inmost point.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        一两年前，一位年轻的英国作家发表了中肯的看法。他说，初稿是才华，以后各稿是艺术。也是由于这个原因，作家同任何艺术家一样，找不到可休息的场所，找不到伙伴和活动使自己得到安逸。任何局外人的判断也比不上他自己内心的正确判断。一旦作家从内心的紊乱中理出头绪，就应按任何评论家想象不到的无情规范约束自己去写作；当他沽名钓誉时，他就脱离了自我生活，脱离了对自己灵魂最深处世界的探索。

    <p class="title">Lesson 44 Patterns of culture 文化的模式</p>
    <p class="en">Custom has not commonly been regarded as a subject of any great moment. The inner workings of our
        own
        brains we feel to be uniquely worthy of investigation, but custom, we have a way of thinking, is behavior at its
        most commonplace. As a matter of fact, it is the other way around. Traditional custom, taken the world over, is
        a
        mass of detailed behavior more astonishing than what any one person can ever evolve in individual actions, no
        matter
        how aberrant. Yet that is a rather trivial aspect of the matter. The fact of first-rate importance is the
        predominant role that custom plays in experience and in belief, and the very great varieties it may manifest.
    </p>
    <p class="cn">
        风俗一般未被认为是什么重要的课题。我们觉得，只有我们大脑内部的活动情况才值得研究，至于风俗呢，只是些司空见惯的行为而已。事实上，情况正好相反。从世界范围来看，传统风俗是由许多细节性的习惯行为组成，它比任何个人养成的行为都更加引人注目，不管个人行为多么异常。这只是问题的一个次要的侧面。最重要的是，风俗在实践中和信仰上所起的举足轻重的作用，以及它所表现出来的极其丰富多彩的形式。
    </p>
    <p class="en">No man ever looks at the world with pristine eyes. He sees it edited by a definite set of customs
        and
        institutions and ways of thinking. Even in his philosophical probings he cannot go behind these stereotypes; his
        very concepts of the true and the false will still have reference to his particular traditional customs. John
        Dewey
        has said in all seriousness that the part played by custom in shaping the behavior of the individual, as against
        any
        way in which he can affect traditional custom, is as the proportion of the total vocabulary of his mother tongue
        against those words of his own baby talk that are taken up into the vernacular of his family. When one seriously
        studies the social orders that have had the opportunity to develop autonomously, the figure becomes no more than
        an
        exact and matter-of-fact observation. The life history of the individual is first and foremost an accommodation
        to
        the patterns and standards traditionally handed down in his community. From the moment of his birth, the customs
        into which he is born shape his experience and behavior. By the time he can talk, he is the little creature of
        his
        culture, and by the time he is grown and able to take part in its activities, its habits are his habits, its
        beliefs
        his beliefs, its impossibilities his impossibilities. Every child that is born into his group will share them
        with
        him, and no child born into one on the opposite side of the globe can ever achieve the thousandth part. There is
        no
        social problem it is more incumbent upon us to understand than this of the role of custom. Until we are
        intelligent
        as to its laws and varieties, the main complicating facts of human life must remain unintelligible.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        没有一个人是用纯洁而无偏见的眼光看待世界。人们所看到的是一个受特定的风俗习惯、制度和思想方式剪辑过的世界。甚至在哲学领域的探索中，人们也无法超越这些定型的框框。人们关于真与伪的概念依然和特定的传统风俗有关。约翰-杜威曾经非常严肃地指出：风俗在形成个人行为方面所起的作用和一个人对风俗的任何影响相比，就好像他本国语言的总词汇量和自己咿呀学语时他家庭所接纳的他的词汇量之比。当一个人认真地研究自发形成的社会秩序时，杜威的比喻就是他实事求是观察得来的形象化的说法。个人的生活史首先就是适应他的社团世代相传形成的生活方式和准则。从他呱呱坠地的时刻起，他所生于其中的风俗就开始塑造他的经历和行为规范。到他会说话时，他就是传统文化塑造的一个小孩子了；等他长大了，能做各种事了，他的社团的习惯就是他的习惯，他的社团的信仰就是他的信仰，他的社团不能做的事就是他不能做的事。每一个和他诞生在同一个社团中的孩子和他一样具有相同的风俗；而在地球的另一边，诞生在另一个社团的孩子与他就很少有相同的风俗。没有任何一个社会问题比得上风俗的作用问题更要求我们对它理解。直到我们理解了风俗的规律性和多样性，我们才能明白人类生活中主要的复杂现象。
    </p>
    <p class="en">The study of custom can be profitable only after certain preliminary propositions have been
        accepted,
        and
        some of these propositions have been violently opposed. In the first place, any scientific study requires that
        there
        be no preferential weighting of one or another of the items in the series it selects for its consideration. In
        all
        the less controversial fields, like the study of cacti or termites or the nature of nebulae, the necessary
        method of
        study is to group the relevant material and to take note of all possible variant forms and conditions. In this
        way,
        we have learned all that we know of the laws of astronomy, or of the habits of the social insects, let us say.
        It is
        only in the study of man himself that the major social sciences have substituted the study of one local
        variation,
        that of Western civilization.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        对习俗的研究只有在某些初步命题被接受，其中一些命题遭到激烈反对之后，才能有所收获。首先，任何科学研究都要求不偏重于研究对象系列中的某一个项目。在所有争议较少的领域，如仙人掌、白蚁或星云性质的研究中，必要的研究方法是将相关材料分组，并注意到所有可能的变化形式和条件。通过这种方法，我们已经了解了天文学规律或社会昆虫习性的所有知识。只是在研究人类本身时，主要的社会科学才以研究西方文明这一局部变体取而代之。
    </p>
    <p class="en">Anthropology was by definition impossible, as long as these distinctions between ourselves and the
        primitive, ourselves and the barbarian, ourselves and the pagan, held sway over people's minds. It was necessary
        first to arrive at that degree of sophistication where we no longer set our own belief against our neighbor’s
        superstition. It was necessary to recognize that these institutions which are based on the same premises, let us
        say
        the supernatural, must be considered together, our own among the rest.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        人类学从定义上来说是不可能的，只要我们自己与原始、我们自己与野蛮人、我们自己与异教徒之间的这些区别还在人们的头脑中占据主导地位。首先，我们必须达到这样一种复杂程度，即我们不再将自己的信仰与邻居的迷信对立起来。我们必须认识到，这些建立在相同前提下的制度，比如说超自然的制度，必须放在一起考虑，我们自己的制度是其他制度中的一种。

    <p class="title">Lesson 46 Hobbies业余爱好</p>
    <p class="en">A gifted American psychologist has said, ‘Worry is a spasm of the emotion; the mind catches hold of
        something and will not let it go.’ It is useless to argue with the mind in this condition. The stronger the
        will,
        the more futile the task. One can only gently insinuate something else into its convulsive grasp. And if this
        something else is rightly chosen, if it is really attended by the illumination of another field of interest,
        gradually, and often quite swiftly, the old undue grip relaxes and the process of recuperation and repair
        begins.
    </p>
    <p class="cn">
        一位天才的美国心理学家曾经说过：“烦恼是感情的发作，此时脑子纠缠住了某种东西又不肯松手。”在这种情况下，你和头脑争吵让它松手是无济于事的。这种意志越是强烈，这种尝试越是徒劳。你只能缓和而巧妙地让另一种东西进入痉挛僵持的头脑中。如果选得合适，而且的确受到别的领域的情趣的启迪，那么渐渐地，往往也是很顺利地，原先不适当的紧张就会松弛下来，恢复和修整的过程就会开始。
    </p>
    <p class="en">The cultivation of a hobby and new forms of interest is therefore a policy of the first importance
        to
        a
        public man. But this is not a business that can be undertaken in a day or swiftly improvised by a mere command
        of
        the will. The growth of alternative mental interests is a long process. The seeds must be carefully chosen; they
        must fall on good ground; they must be sedulously tended, if the vivifying fruits are to be at hand when needed.
    </p>
    <p class="en">To be really happy and really safe, one ought to have at least two or three hobbies, and they must
        all be
        real. It is no use starting late in life to say: ‘I will take an interest in this or that.’ Such an attempt only
        aggravates the strain of mental effort. A man may acquire great knowledge of topics unconnected with his daily
        work,
        and yet get hardly any benefit or relief. It is no use doing what you like; you have got to like what you do.
        Broadly speaking, human beings may be divided into three classes: those who are toiled to death, those who are
        worried to death, and those who are bored to death. It is no use offering the manual laborer, tired out with a
        hard
        week's sweat and effort, the chance of playing a game of football or baseball on Saturday afternoon. It is no
        use
        inviting the politician or the professional or business man, who has been working or worrying about serious
        things
        for six days, to work or worry about trifling things at the weekend.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        因此，对一个从事社会活动的人来说，培养一种业余爱好和各种新的兴趣是头等重要的作法。但这并非一日之功，也不是单凭意志一蹴而就的事。精神上多种情趣的培养是一个长期的过程。要想在需要的时候可随手摘取充满生机的果实，那就必然从精选良种做起，然后将其植入肥沃的土地，还需要勤勉地护理。
    </p>
    <p class="en">As for the unfortunate people who can command everything they want, who can gratify every caprice
        and
        lay
        their hands on almost every object of desire----for them a new pleasure, a new excitement is only an additional
        satiation. In vain they rush frantically round from place to place, trying to escape from avenging boredom by
        mere
        clatter and motion. For them discipline in one form or another is the most hopeful path.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        一个人要想真正感到幸福和平安，至少应有两三种爱好，而且都比较实际。到了晚年才开始说：“我会对这个或那个发生兴趣”，已没有用了。这种愿望只能加剧精神紧张。一个人可能会获得与其日常工作无关的某些课题的渊博知识，而没有从中得到什么实益或宽慰。干你所喜欢的事是没有用的，你得喜欢你所干的事。泛泛地说，人可以分为
        3类：劳累至死的人、忧虑至死的人、无聊至死的人。对于流汗出力干了一周苦活的体力劳动者来说，让他们在星期六下午再踢足球或打垒球是不合适的；同样，对于为严肃的公务操劳或烦恼了6天的政界人士、专业技术人员、商人来说，在周末再让他们为琐事而动脑子和忧虑也是无益的。
    </p>
    <p class="en">It may also be said that rational, industrious, useful human beings are divided into two classes:
        first,
        those whose work is work and whose pleasure is pleasure; and secondly, those whose work and pleasure are one. Of
        these the former are the majority. They have their compensations. The long hours in the office or the factory
        bring
        with them as their reward, not only the means of sustenance, but a keen appetite for pleasure even in its
        simplest
        and most modest forms. But Fortune's favored children belong to the second class.Their life is a natural
        harmony.
        For them the working hours are never long enough. Each day is a holiday, and ordinary holidays, when they come,
        are
        grudged as enforced interruptions in an absorbing vocation. Yet to both classes, the need of an alternative
        outlook,
        of a change of atmosphere, of a diversion of effort, is essential. Indeed, it may well be that those whose work
        is
        their pleasure are those who most need the means of banishing it at intervals from their minds.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        至于那些能任意支配一切的“可怜的人”，他们能够恣意妄为，能染指一切追求的目标。对这种人来说，多一种新的乐趣、多一种新的刺激只是增加一分厌腻而已。他们到处狂奔乱跑，企图以闲聊和乱窜来摆脱无聊对他们的报复，但这是徒劳的。对他们来说，用某种形式的纪律约束他们一下才能有希望使他们走上正道。
    </p>
    <p class="cn">
        也可以这样说，理智的、勤劳的、有用的人可以分为两类：第一类是分清工作是工作，娱乐是娱乐的人；第二类人的工作和娱乐是一回事。这两类人当中，第一类人是大多数，他们能够得到补偿。在办公室或工厂里长时间的工作给他们带来了酬劳，这不仅是谋生的手段，而且还带来了寻找乐趣的强烈欲望。那怕是最简单的、最低等的乐趣。但是，命运之神的宠儿是第二类人，他们的生活是一种自然的和谐，对他们来说，工作时间总不会太长，每天都是假日，而通常的假期到来时，他们却惋惜这假期强制打断了他们埋头从事的工作。然而对这两种人来说，都需要换一换脑子，改变一下气氛，转移一下注意力，这是不可缺少的。说实在的，把工作当作享受的那些人可能最需要每隔一段时间把工作从头脑中撇开。

    <p class="title">Lesson 47 The great escape大逃亡</p>
    <p class="en">Economy is one powerful motive for camping, since after the initial outlay upon equipment, or
        through
        hiring it, the total expense can be far less than the cost of hotels. But, contrary to a popular assumption, it
        is
        far from being the only one, or even the greatest. The man who manoeuvres carelessly into his twenty pounds'
        worth
        of space at one of Europe's myriad permanent sites may find himself bumping a Bentley. More likely, Ford Escort
        will
        be hub to hub with Renault or Mercedes, but rarely with bicycles made for two.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        图省钱是露营的一个主要动机，因为除了开始时购置或是租借一套露营装备外，总费用算起来要比住旅馆开支少得多。但是，和一般的看法相反，这决非是仅有的，甚至不是最主要的动机。如果一位游客漫不经心地驾车驶入欧洲无数常年营地之一，花20镑租用一个空位，那么他可能会碰见一辆本特利汽车，更可能会望见一辆福特-康索尔和一辆雷诺或一辆梅塞迪斯并排停放着，不过双人自行车则不容易看到。
    </p>
    <p class="en">That the equipment of modern camping becomes yearly more sophisticated is an entertaining paradox
        for
        the
        cynic, a brighter promise for the hopeful traveller who has sworn to get away from it all. It also
        provides---and
        some student sociologist might care to base his thesis upon the phenomenon----an escape of another kind. The
        modern
        traveller is often a man who dislikes the Splendide and the Bellavista， not because he cannot afford, or shuns
        their
        material comforts, but because he is afraid of them. Affluent he may be, but he is by no means sure what to tip
        the
        doorman or the chambermaid. Master in his own house, he has little idea of when to say boo to a maitre d`hotel.
    </p>
    <p class="cn">
        现代露营装备一年比一年讲究，这对那些厌世嫉俗者来说是一件有趣的自相矛盾的事情。而对于发誓用露营来摆脱烦恼的人来说，却带来了更光明的前景。学社会学的大学生来露营是另一种形式的摆脱现实，他们的目的很可能是根据观察到的露营现象去写论文。现代露营旅游的人往往讨厌住“斯普兰迪德”和“贝拉维斯塔”这样的大酒店，这并不是因为他们付不起钱，也不是为了躲避物质享受，而是因为他们害怕酒店。他们可能很富有，但给看门人和房间女服务员多少小费，心中却根本没有数；他们在家可能是主人，但不知道什么时候才能对酒店的经理表示不满。
    </p>
    <p class="en">From all such fears camping releases him. Granted, a snobbery of camping itself, based upon
        equipment
        and
        techniques, already exists; but it is of a kind that, if he meets it, he can readily understand and deal with.
        There
        is no superior ‘they’ in the shape of managements and hotel hierarchies to darken his holiday days.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        露营使人们免除了这些忧虑。诚然，露营地本身也存在以露营装备和方式取人的势利现象，但如果有这种情况，露营者也容易理解，知道如何对付，但在露营地里根本不会有管人的“人上人”和酒店里的等级制度来使露营者的假日过得阴郁低沉。
    </p>
    <p class="en">To such motives, yet another must be added. The contemporary phenomenon of car worship is to be
        explained
        not least by the sense of independence and freedom that ownership entails. To this pleasure camping gives an
        exquisite refinement.</p>
    <p class="cn">除了以上动机外，还应再加上一个。当前崇拜汽车现象可以用与所有权相伴的独立和自由意识来解释。因此开车去露营会给这种快乐意识增加一种优雅意境。</p>
    <p class="en">From one's own front door to home or foreign hills or sands and back again, everything is to hand.
        Not
        only are the means of arriving at the holiday paradise entirely within one's own command and keeping, but the
        means
        of escape from holiday hell (if the beach proves too crowded, the local weather too inclement) are there,
        outside----or, as likely, part of----the tent.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        从自己的家门出发到国内国外的山区或沙滩上露营然后返回，一切都很便利。完全在自己掌握之中的私人汽车不仅是到达假日天堂的工具，而且也是逃离假日地狱（如海滩太挤，当地天气恶劣）的方便工具，因为汽车就停在帐篷外面，或者汽车本身可能就是露营帐篷的一个组成部分。
    </p>
    <p class="en">Idealists have objected to the practice of camping, as to the package tour, that the traveller
        abroad
        thereby denies himself the opportunity of getting to know the people of the country visited. Insularity and
        self-containment, it is argued, go hand in hand. The opinion does not survive experience of a popular
        Continental
        camping place. Holiday hotels tend to cater for one nationality of visitors especially, sometimes exclusively.
        Camping sites, by contrast, are highly cosmopolitan. Granted, a preponderance of Germans is a characteristic
        that
        seems common to most Mediterranean sites; but as yet there is no overwhelmingly specialized patronage. Notices
        forbidding the open-air drying of clothes, or the use of water points for car washing, or those inviting ‘our
        camping friends’ to a dance or a boat trip are printed not only in French or Italian or Spanish, but also in
        English, German and Dutch. At meal times the odour of sauerkraut vies with that of garlic. The Frenchman's
        breakfast
        coffee competes with the Englishman's bacon and eggs.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        理想主义者像反对旅行社安排一切的一揽子旅游一样反对露营的作法，说这种封闭的作法使到国外旅游者失去了了解所去国家人民的机会。他们争论说，心胸狭窄和自我封闭是并存的。但这种说法在受人欢迎的欧洲露营场地是站不住脚的。假日旅馆有只接待来自一个国家的旅游者的倾向，有时会达到排他的程度。而露营驻地则相反，是高度世界性的。在大多数地中海露营地里，德国人占优势似乎是个普遍现象，确实如此，但并没有特别的优待。禁止露天晒衣服、禁止用水龙头冲洗汽车的布告和邀请露营朋友参加舞会、乘船观光的招贴不仅印成法语、意大利语、西班牙语，而且也印成英语、德语、荷兰语。用饭的时候，德国泡菜味和大蒜味争相散发，法国人的早点咖啡和英国人的咸肉煎蛋竞相比美。
    </p>
    <p class="en">Whether the remarkable growth of organized camping means the eventual death of the more independent
        kind
        is hard to say. Municipalities naturally want to secure the campers'site fees and other custom. Police are wary
        of
        itinerants who cannot be traced to a recognized camp boundary or to four walls. But most probably it will all
        depend
        upon campers themselves: how many heath fires they cause; how much litter they leave; in short, whether or not
        they
        wholly alienate landowners and those who live in the countryside. Only good scouting is likely to preserve the
        freedoms so dear to the heart of the eternal Boy Scout.</p>
    <p class="cn">
        有组织的露营活动的明显发展是否意味着较独立的自我封闭式露营的最终消失，还很难说。市政当局当然希望获得露营者的场地费和其他光临的好处，警察则对那些查不出有固定营地或住处的游荡者保持警惕。但最重要的或许是露营者自己，即他们引起了多少场野火，留下了多少垃圾。总之，他们是否弄得土地的主人和乡间的居民同他们反目。只有优良的童子军活动才能保持不朽的童子军所衷心热爱的各项自由。
